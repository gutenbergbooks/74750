    <h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
  </div>

  <p>I am indebted to the generosity of the Board of Fellowships in the
    Biological Sciences of the National Research Council whose award of
    a fellowship made this investigation possible. I have to thank my
    father for the gift of my travelling expenses to and from the Samoan
    Islands. To Prof. Franz Boas I owe the inspiration and the direction
    of my problem, the training which prepared me to undertake such an
    investigation, and the criticism of my results.</p>

  <p>For a co-operation which greatly facilitated the progress of my work in
    the Pacific, I am indebted to Dr. Herbert E. Gregory, Director of the
    B. P. Bishop Museum and to Dr. E. C. S. Handy and Miss Stella Jones of
    the Bishop Museum.</p>

  <p>To the endorsement of my work by Admiral Stitt and the kindness of
    Commander Owen Mink, U. S. N., I owe the co-operation of the medical
    authorities in Samoa, whose assistance greatly simplified and expedited
    my investigation. I have to thank Miss Ellen M. Hodgson, Chief Nurse,
    the staff nurses, the Samoan nurses, and particularly G. F. Pepe
    for my first contacts and my instruction in the Samoan language. To
    the hospitality, generosity, and sympathetic co-operation of Mr.
    Edward R. Holt, Chief Pharmacist Mate, and Mrs. Holt, I owe the four
    months’ residence in their home which furnished me with an absolutely
    essential neutral base from which I could study all the individuals
    in the village and yet remain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>aloof from native feuds and lines of
    demarcation.</p>

  <p>The success of this investigation depended upon the co-operation and
    interest of several hundred Samoans. To mention each one individually
    would be impossible. I owe special thanks to County Chief Ufuti of
    Vaitogi and to all the members of his household and to the Talking
    Chief Lolo, who taught me the rudiments of the graceful pattern of
    social relations which is so characteristic of the Samoans. I must
    specially thank their excellencies, Tufele, Governor of Manu’a, and
    County Chiefs Tui Olesega, Misa, Sotoa, Asoao, and Leui, the Chiefs
    Pomele, Nua, Tialigo, Moa, Maualupe, Asi, and the Talking Chiefs Lapui
    and Muao; the Samoan pastors Solomona and Iakopo, the Samoan teachers,
    Sua, Napoleon, and Eti; Toaga, the wife of Sotoa, Fa’apua’a, the Taupo
    of Fitiuta, Fofoa, Laula, Leauala, and Felofiaina, and the chiefs
    and people of all the villages of Manu’a and their children. Their
    kindness, hospitality, and courtesy made my sojourn among them a happy
    one; their co-operation and interest made it possible for me to pursue
    my investigation with peace and profit. The fact that no real names are
    used in the course of the book is to shield the feelings of those who
    would not enjoy such publicity.</p>

  <p>For criticism and assistance in the preparation of this manuscript
    I am indebted to Dr. R. F. Benedict, Dr. L. S. Cressman, Miss M. E.
    Eichelberger, and Mrs. M. L. Loeb.</p>

  <p>Modern descriptions of primitive people give us a picture of their
    culture classified according to the varied aspects of human life.
    We learn about inventions, household economy, family and political
    organisation, and religious beliefs and practices. Through a
    comparative study of these data and through information that tells us
    of their growth and development, we endeavour to reconstruct, as well
    as may be, the history of each particular culture. Some anthropologists
    even hope that the comparative study will reveal some tendencies of
    development that recur so often that significant generalisations
    regarding the processes of cultural growth will be discovered.</p>

  <p>To the lay reader these studies are interesting on account of the
    strangeness of the scene, the peculiar attitudes characteristic of
    foreign cultures that set off in strong light our own achievements and
    behaviour.</p>

  <p>However, a systematic description of human activities gives us very
    little insight into the mental attitudes of the individual. His
    thoughts and actions appear merely as expressions of rigidly defined
    cultural forms. We learn little about his rational thinking, about
    his friendships and conflicts with his fellowmen. The personal side
    of the life of the individual is almost eliminated <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>in the systematic
    presentation of the cultural life of the people. The picture is
    standardised, like a collection of laws that tell us how we should
    behave, and not how we behave; like rules set down defining the style
    of art, but not the way in which the artist elaborates his ideas
    of beauty; like a list of inventions, and not the way in which the
    individual overcomes technical difficulties that present themselves.</p>

  <p>And yet the way in which the personality reacts to culture is a matter
    that should concern us deeply and that makes the studies of foreign
    cultures a fruitful and useful field of research. We are accustomed to
    consider all those actions that are part and parcel of our own culture,
    standards which we follow automatically, as common to all mankind. They
    are deeply ingrained in our behaviour. We are moulded in their forms so
    that we cannot think but that they must be valid everywhere.</p>

  <p>Courtesy, modesty, good manners, conformity to definite ethical
    standards are universal, but what constitutes courtesy, modesty, good
    manners, and ethical standards is not universal. It is instructive to
    know that standards differ in the most unexpected ways. It is still
    more important to know how the individual reacts to these standards.</p>

  <p>In our own civilisation the individual is beset with difficulties which
    we are likely to ascribe to fundamental human traits. When we speak
    about the difficulties of childhood and of adolescence, we are thinking
    of them <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>as unavoidable periods of adjustment through which every one
    has to pass. The whole psycho-analytic approach is largely based on
    this supposition.</p>

  <p>The anthropologist doubts the correctness of these views, but up to
    this time hardly any one has taken the pains to identify himself
    sufficiently with a primitive population to obtain an insight into
    these problems. We feel, therefore, grateful to Miss Mead for having
    undertaken to identify herself so completely with Samoan youth that
    she gives us a lucid and clear picture of the joys and difficulties
    encountered by the young individual in a culture so entirely different
    from our own. The results of her painstaking investigation confirm the
    suspicion long held by anthropologists, that much of what we ascribe to
    human nature is no more than a reaction to the restraints put upon us
    by our civilisation.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">INTRODUCTION</div>

  <p>During the last hundred years parents and teachers have ceased to take
    childhood and adolescence for granted. They have attempted to fit
    education to the needs of the child, rather than to press the child
    into an inflexible educational mould. To this new task they have been
    spurred by two forces, the growth of the science of psychology, and
    the difficulties and maladjustments of youth. Psychology suggested
    that much might be gained by a knowledge of the way in which children
    developed, of the stages through which they passed, of what the adult
    world might reasonably expect of the baby of two months or the child
    of two years. And the fulminations of the pulpit, the loudly voiced
    laments of the conservative social philosopher, the records of juvenile
    courts and social agencies all suggested that something must be done
    with the period which science had named adolescence. The spectacle of
    a younger generation diverging ever more widely from the standards
    and ideals of the past, cut adrift without the anchorage of respected
    home standards or group religious values, terrified the cautious
    reactionary, tempted the radical propagandist to missionary crusades
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>among the defenceless youth, and worried the least thoughtful among us.</p>

  <p>In American civilisation, with its many immigrant strains, its dozens
    of conflicting standards of conduct, its hundreds of religious sects,
    its shifting economic conditions, this unsettled, disturbed status of
    youth was more apparent than in the older, more settled civilisation of
    Europe. American conditions challenged the psychologist, the educator,
    the social philosopher, to offer acceptable explanations of the growing
    children’s plight. As to-day in post-war Germany, where the younger
    generation has even more difficult adjustments to make than have our
    own children, a great mass of theorising about adolescence is flooding
    the book shops; so the psychologist in America tried to account for
    the restlessness of youth. The result was works like that of Stanley
    Hall on “Adolescence,” which ascribed to the period through which the
    children were passing, the causes of their conflict and distress.
    Adolescence was characterised as the period in which idealism flowered
    and rebellion against authority waxed strong, a period during which
    difficulties and conflicts were absolutely inevitable.</p>

  <p>The careful child psychologist who relied upon experiment for his
    conclusions did not subscribe to these theories. He said, “We have no
    data. We know only a little about the first few months of a child’s
    life. We are only just learning when a baby’s eyes will first follow
    a light. How can we give definite answers to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>questions of how a
    developed personality, about which we know nothing, will respond to
    religion?” But the negative cautions of science are never popular. If
    the experimentalist would not commit himself, the social philosopher,
    the preacher and the pedagogue tried the harder to give a short-cut
    answer. They observed the behaviour of adolescents in our society,
    noted down the omnipresent and obvious symptoms of unrest, and
    announced these as characteristics of the period. Mothers were warned
    that “daughters in their teens” present special problems. This, said
    the theorists, is a difficult period. The physical changes which are
    going on in the bodies of your boys and girls have their definite
    psychological accompaniments. You can no more evade one than you can
    the other; as your daughter’s body changes from the body of a child to
    the body of a woman, so inevitably will her spirit change, and that
    stormily. The theorists looked about them again at the adolescents in
    our civilisation and repeated with great conviction, “Yes, stormily.”</p>

  <p>Such a view, though unsanctioned by the cautious experimentalist,
    gained wide currency, influenced our educational policy, paralysed
    our parental efforts. Just as the mother must brace herself against
    the baby’s crying when it cuts its first tooth, so she must fortify
    herself and bear with what equanimity she might the unlovely, turbulent
    manifestations of the “awkward age.” If there was nothing to blame the
    child for, neither was there any programme except endurance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>which
    might be urged upon the teacher. The theorist continued to observe the
    behaviour of American adolescents and each year lent new justification
    to his hypothesis, as the difficulties of youth were illustrated and
    documented in the records of schools and juvenile courts.</p>

  <p>But meanwhile another way of studying human development had been
    gaining ground, the approach of the anthropologist, the student of man
    in all of his most diverse social settings. The anthropologist, as he
    pondered his growing body of material upon the customs of primitive
    people, grew to realise the tremendous rôle played in an individual’s
    life by the social environment in which each is born and reared. One
    by one, aspects of behaviour which we had been accustomed to consider
    invariable complements of our humanity were found to be merely a result
    of civilisation, present in the inhabitants of one country, absent in
    another country, and this without a change of race. He learned that
    neither race nor common humanity can be held responsible for many of
    the forms which even such basic human emotions as love and fear and
    anger take under different social conditions.</p>

  <p>So the anthropologist, arguing from his observations of the behaviour
    of adult human beings in other civilisations, reaches many of
    the same conclusions which the behaviourist reaches in his work
    upon human babies who have as yet no civilisation to shape their
    malleable humanity. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>With such an attitude towards human nature the
    anthropologist listened to the current comment upon adolescence.
    He heard attitudes which seemed to him dependent upon social
    environment—such as rebellion against authority, philosophical
    perplexities, the flowering of idealism, conflict and struggle—ascribed
    to a period of physical development. And on the basis of his knowledge
    of the determinism of culture, of the plasticity of human beings, he
    doubted. Were these difficulties due to being adolescent or to being
    adolescent in America?</p>

  <p>For the biologist who doubts an old hypothesis or wishes to test out a
    new one, there is the biological laboratory. There, under conditions
    over which he can exercise the most rigid control, he can vary the
    light, the air, the food, which his plants or his animals receive,
    from the moment of birth throughout their lifetime. Keeping all the
    conditions but one constant, he can make accurate measurement of the
    effect of the one. This is the ideal method of science, the method
    of the controlled experiment, through which all hypotheses may be
    submitted to a strict objective test.</p>

  <p>Even the student of infant psychology can only partially reproduce
    these ideal laboratory conditions. He cannot control the pre-natal
    environment of the child whom he will later subject to objective
    measurement. He can, however, control the early environment of the
    child, the first few days of its existence, and decide what sounds
    and sights and smells and tastes are to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>impinge upon it. But for
    the student of the adolescent there is no such simplicity of working
    conditions. What we wish to test is no less than the effect of
    civilisation upon a developing human being at the age of puberty.
    To test it most rigorously we would have to construct various sorts
    of different civilisations and subject large numbers of adolescent
    children to these different environments. We would list the influences
    the effects of which we wished to study. If we wished to study the
    influence of the size of the family, we would construct a series of
    civilisations alike in every respect except in family organisation.
    Then if we found differences in the behaviour of our adolescents we
    could say with assurance that size of family had caused the difference,
    that, for instance, the only child had a more troubled adolescence than
    the child who was a member of a large family. And so we might proceed
    through a dozen possible situations—early or late sex knowledge, early
    or late sex-experience, pressure towards precocious development,
    discouragement of precocious development, segregation of the sexes
    or coeducation from infancy, division of labour between the sexes or
    common tasks for both, pressure to make religious choices young or
    the lack of such pressure. We would vary one factor, while the others
    remained quite constant, and analyse which, if any, of the aspects of
    our civilisation were responsible for the difficulties of our children
    at adolescence.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, such ideal methods of experiment <span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>are denied to us when
    our materials are humanity and the whole fabric of a social order. The
    test colony of Herodotus, in which babies were to be isolated and the
    results recorded, is not a possible approach. Neither is the method of
    selecting from our own civilisation groups of children who meet one
    requirement or another. Such a method would be to select five hundred
    adolescents from small families and five hundred from large families,
    and try to discover which had experienced the greatest difficulties of
    adjustment at adolescence. But we could not know what were the other
    influences brought to bear upon these children, what effect their
    knowledge of sex or their neighbourhood environment may have had upon
    their adolescent development.</p>

  <p>What method then is open to us who wish to conduct a human experiment
    but who lack the power either to construct the experimental conditions
    or to find controlled examples of those conditions here and there
    throughout our own civilisation? The only method is that of the
    anthropologist, to go to a different civilisation and make a study of
    human beings under different cultural conditions in some other part of
    the world. For such studies the anthropologist chooses quite simple
    peoples, primitive peoples, whose society has never attained the
    complexity of our own. In this choice of primitive peoples like the
    Eskimo, the Australian, the South Sea islander, or the Pueblo Indian,
    the anthropologist is guided by the knowledge that the analysis <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>of a
    simpler civilisation is more possible of attainment.</p>

  <p>In complicated civilisations like those of Europe, or the higher
    civilisations of the East, years of study are necessary before the
    student can begin to understand the forces at work within them. A
    study of the French family alone would involve a preliminary study of
    French history, of French law, of the Catholic and Protestant attitudes
    towards sex and personal relations. A primitive people without a
    written language present a much less elaborate problem and a trained
    student can master the fundamental structure of a primitive society in
    a few months.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, we do not choose a simple peasant community in Europe
    or an isolated group of mountain whites in the American South, for
    these people’s ways of life, though simple, belong essentially to the
    historical tradition to which the complex parts of European or American
    civilisation belong. Instead, we choose primitive groups who have had
    thousands of years of historical development along completely different
    lines from our own, whose language does not possess our Indo-European
    categories, whose religious ideas are of a different nature, whose
    social organisation is not only simpler but very different from our
    own. From these contrasts, which are vivid enough to startle and
    enlighten those accustomed to our own way of life and simple enough
    to be grasped quickly, it is possible to learn many things about the
    effect of a civilisation upon the individuals within it. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>So, in order
    to investigate the particular problem, I chose to go not to Germany or
    to Russia, but to Samoa, a South Sea island about thirteen degrees from
    the Equator, inhabited by a brown Polynesian people. Because I was a
    woman and could hope for greater intimacy in working with girls rather
    than with boys, and because owing to a paucity of women ethnologists
    our knowledge of primitive girls is far slighter than our knowledge of
    boys, I chose to concentrate upon the adolescent girl in Samoa.</p>

  <p>But in concentrating, I did something very different from what I would
    do if I concentrated upon a study of the adolescent girl in Kokomo,
    Indiana. In such a study, I would go right to the crux of the problem;
    I would not have to linger long over the Indiana language, the table
    manners or sleeping habits of my subjects, or make an exhaustive study
    of how they learned to dress themselves, to use the telephone, or what
    the concept of conscience meant in Kokomo. All these things are the
    general fabric of American life, known to me as investigator, known to
    you as readers.</p>

  <p>But with this new experiment on the primitive adolescent girl the
    matter was quite otherwise. She spoke a language the very sounds of
    which were strange, a language in which nouns became verbs and verbs
    nouns in the most sleight-of-hand fashion. All of her habits of life
    were different. She sat cross-legged on the ground, and to sit upon a
    chair made her stiff and miserable. She ate with her fingers from a
    woven plate; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>she slept upon the floor. Her house was a mere circle of
    pillars, roofed by a cone of thatch, carpeted with water-worn coral
    fragments. Her whole material environment was different. Cocoanut palm,
    breadfruit, and mango trees swayed above her village. She had never
    seen a horse, knew no animals except the pig, dog and rat. Her food was
    taro, breadfruit and bananas, fish and wild pigeon and half-roasted
    pork, and land crabs. And just as it was necessary to understand this
    physical environment, this routine of life which was so different from
    ours, so her social environment in its attitudes towards children,
    towards sex, towards personality, presented as strong a contrast to the
    social environment of the American girl.</p>

  <p>I concentrated upon the girls of the community. I spent the greater
    part of my time with them. I studied most closely the households
    in which adolescent girls lived. I spent more time in the games of
    children than in the councils of their elders. Speaking their language,
    eating their food, sitting barefoot and cross-legged upon the pebbly
    floor, I did my best to minimise the differences between us and to
    learn to know and understand all the girls of three little villages on
    the coast of the little island of Taū, in the Manu’a Archipelago.</p>

  <p>Through the nine months which I spent in Samoa, I gathered many
    detailed facts about these girls, the size of their families, the
    position and wealth of their parents, the number of their brothers
    and sisters, the amount of sex experience which they had had. All of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>these routine facts are summarised in a table in the appendix. They
    are only the barest skeleton, hardly the raw materials for a study
    of family situations and sex relations, standards of friendship, of
    loyalty, of personal responsibility, all those impalpable storm centres
    of disturbances in the lives of our adolescent girls. And because
    these less measurable parts of their lives were so similar, because
    one girl’s life was so much like another’s, in an uncomplex, uniform
    culture like Samoa, I feel justified in generalising although I studied
    only fifty girls in three small neighbouring villages.</p>

  <p>In the following chapters I have described the lives of these girls,
    the lives of their younger sisters who will soon be adolescent, of
    their brothers with whom a strict taboo forbids them to speak, of their
    older sisters who have left puberty behind them, of their elders,
    the mothers and fathers whose attitudes towards life determine the
    attitudes of their children. And through this description I have tried
    to answer the question which sent me to Samoa: Are the disturbances
    which vex our adolescents due to the nature of adolescence itself or to
    the civilisation? Under different conditions does adolescence present a
    different picture?</p>

  <p>Also, by the nature of the problem, because of the unfamiliarity of
    this simple life on a small Pacific island, I have had to give a
    picture of the whole social life of Samoa, the details being selected
    always with a view to illuminating the problem of adolescence. Matters
    of political organisation which neither interest nor influence the
    young girl are not included. Minutiæ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>of relationship systems or
    ancestor cults, genealogies and mythology, which are of interest only
    to the specialist, will be published in another place. But I have tried
    to present to the reader the Samoan girl in her social setting, to
    describe the course of her life from birth until death, the problems
    she will have to solve, the values which will guide her in her
    solutions, the pains and pleasures of her human lot cast on a South Sea
    island.</p>

  <p>Such a description seeks to do more than illuminate this particular
    problem. It should also give the reader some conception of a different
    and contrasting civilisation, another way of life, which other members
    of the human race have found satisfactory and gracious. We know that
    our subtlest perceptions, our highest values, are all based upon
    contrast; that light without darkness or beauty without ugliness would
    lose the qualities which they now appear to us to have. And similarly,
    if we would appreciate our own civilisation, this elaborate pattern of
    life which we have made for ourselves as a people and which we are at
    such pains to pass on to our children, we must set our civilisation
    over against other very different ones. The traveller in Europe returns
    to America, sensitive to nuances in his own manners and philosophies
    which have hitherto gone unremarked, yet Europe and America are parts
    of one civilisation. It is with variations within one great pattern
    that the student of Europe to-day or the student of our own history
    sharpens his sense of appreciation. But if we step outside the stream
    of Indo-European <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>culture, the appreciation which we can accord our
    civilisation is even more enhanced. Here in remote parts of the world,
    under historical conditions very different from those which made
    Greece and Rome flourish and fall, groups of human beings have worked
    out patterns of life so different from our own that we cannot venture
    any guess that they would ever have arrived at our solutions. Each
    primitive people has selected one set of human gifts, one set of human
    values, and fashioned for themselves an art, a social organisation,
    a religion, which is their unique contribution to the history of the
    human spirit.</p>

  <p>Samoa is only one of these diverse and gracious patterns, but as the
    traveller who has been once from home is wiser than he who has never
    left his own door step, so a knowledge of one other culture should
    sharpen our ability to scrutinise more steadily, to appreciate more
    lovingly, our own.</p>

  <p>And, because of the particular problem which we set out to answer,
    this tale of another way of life is mainly concerned with education,
    with the process by which the baby, arrived cultureless upon the human
    scene, becomes a full-fledged adult member of his or her society. The
    strongest light will fall upon the ways in which Samoan education,
    in its broadest sense, differs from our own. And from this contrast
    we may be able to turn, made newly and vividly self-conscious and
    self-critical, to judge anew and perhaps fashion differently the
    education we give our children.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">A DAY IN SAMOA</div>

  <p>The life of the day begins at dawn, or if the moon has shown until
    daylight, the shouts of the young men may be heard before dawn from
    the hillside. Uneasy in the night, populous with ghosts, they shout
    lustily to one another as they hasten with their work. As the dawn
    begins to fall among the soft brown roofs and the slender palm trees
    stand out against a colourless, gleaming sea, lovers slip home from
    trysts beneath the palm trees or in the shadow of beached canoes,
    that the light may find each sleeper in his appointed place. Cocks
    crow, negligently, and a shrill-voiced bird cries from the breadfruit
    trees. The insistent roar of the reef seems muted to an undertone for
    the sounds of a waking village. Babies cry, a few short wails before
    sleepy mothers give them the breast. Restless little children roll out
    of their sheets and wander drowsily down to the beach to freshen their
    faces in the sea. Boys, bent upon an early fishing, start collecting
    their tackle and go to rouse their more laggard companions. Fires
    are lit, here and there, the white smoke hardly visible against the
    paleness of the dawn. The whole village, sheeted and frowsy, stirs,
    rubs its eyes, and stumbles towards the beach. “Talofa!” “Talofa!”
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>“Will the journey start to-day?” “Is it bonito fishing your lordship
    is going?” Girls stop to giggle over some young ne’er-do-well who
    escaped during the night from an angry father’s pursuit and to venture
    a shrewd guess that the daughter knew more about his presence than she
    told. The boy who is taunted by another, who has succeeded him in his
    sweetheart’s favour, grapples with his rival, his foot slipping in the
    wet sand. From the other end of the village comes a long drawn-out,
    piercing wail. A messenger has just brought word of the death of some
    relative in another village. Half-clad, unhurried women, with babies
    at their breasts, or astride their hips, pause in their tale of Losa’s
    outraged departure from her father’s house to the greater kindness in
    the home of her uncle, to wonder who is dead. Poor relatives whisper
    their requests to rich relatives, men make plans to set a fish trap
    together, a woman begs a bit of yellow dye from a kinswoman, and
    through the village sounds the rhythmic tattoo which calls the young
    men together. They gather from all parts of the village, digging sticks
    in hand, ready to start inland to the plantation. The older men set off
    upon their more lonely occupations, and each household, reassembled
    under its peaked roof, settles down to the routine of the morning.
    Little children, too hungry to wait for the late breakfast, beg lumps
    of cold taro which they munch greedily. Women carry piles of washing
    to the sea or to the spring at the far end of the village, or set off
    inland after weaving materials. The older <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>girls go fishing on the
    reef, or perhaps set themselves to weaving a new set of Venetian blinds.</p>

  <p>In the houses, where the pebbly floors have been swept bare with
    a stiff long-handled broom, the women great with child and the
    nursing mothers, sit and gossip with one another. Old men sit apart,
    unceasingly twisting palm husk on their bare thighs and muttering
    old tales under their breath. The carpenters begin work on the new
    house, while the owner bustles about trying to keep them in a good
    humour. Families who will cook to-day are hard at work; the taro, yams
    and bananas have already been brought from inland; the children are
    scuttling back and forth, fetching sea water, or leaves to stuff the
    pig. As the sun rises higher in the sky, the shadows deepen under the
    thatched roofs, the sand is burning to the touch, the hibiscus flowers
    wilt on the hedges, and little children bid the smaller ones, “Come
    out of the sun.” Those whose excursions have been short return to the
    village, the women with strings of crimson jelly fish, or baskets of
    shell fish, the men with cocoanuts, carried in baskets slung on a
    shoulder pole. The women and children eat their breakfasts, just hot
    from the oven, if this is cook day, and the young men work swiftly in
    the midday heat, preparing the noon feast for their elders.</p>

  <p>It is high noon. The sand burns the feet of the little children,
    who leave their palm leaf balls and their pin-wheels of frangipani
    blossoms to wither in the sun, as they creep into the shade of the
    houses. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>women who must go abroad carry great banana leaves as
    sun-shades or wind wet cloths about their heads. Lowering a few blinds
    against the slanting sun, all who are left in the village wrap their
    heads in sheets and go to sleep. Only a few adventurous children may
    slip away for a swim in the shadow of a high rock, some industrious
    woman continues with her weaving, or a close little group of women bend
    anxiously over a woman in labour. The village is dazzling and dead; any
    sound seems oddly loud and out of place. Words have to cut through the
    solid heat slowly. And then the sun gradually sinks over the sea.</p>

  <p>A second time, the sleeping people stir, roused perhaps by the cry of
    “a boat,” resounding through the village. The fishermen beach their
    canoes, weary and spent from the heat, in spite of the slaked lime
    on their heads, with which they have sought to cool their brains and
    redden their hair. The brightly coloured fishes are spread out on the
    floor, or piled in front of the houses until the women pour water over
    them to free them from taboo. Regretfully, the young fishermen separate
    out the “Taboo fish,” which must be sent to the chief, or proudly they
    pack the little palm leaf baskets with offerings of fish to take to
    their sweethearts. Men come home from the bush, grimy and heavy laden,
    shouting as they come, greeted in a sonorous rising cadence by those
    who have remained at home. They gather in the guest house for their
    evening kava drinking. The soft clapping of hands, the high-pitched
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>intoning of the talking chief who serves the kava echoes through the
    village. Girls gather flowers to weave into necklaces; children, lusty
    from their naps and bound to no particular task, play circular games in
    the half shade of the late afternoon. Finally the sun sets, in a flame
    which stretches from the mountain behind to the horizon on the sea,
    the last bather comes up from the beach, children straggle home, dark
    little figures etched against the sky; lights shine in the houses, and
    each household gathers for its evening meal. The suitor humbly presents
    his offering, the children have been summoned from their noisy play,
    perhaps there is an honoured guest who must be served first, after the
    soft, barbaric singing of Christian hymns and the brief and graceful
    evening prayer. In front of a house at the end of the village, a father
    cries out the birth of a son. In some family circles a face is missing,
    in others little runaways have found a haven! Again quiet settles upon
    the village, as first the head of the household, then the women and
    children, and last of all the patient boys, eat their supper.</p>

  <p>After supper the old people and the little children are bundled off
    to bed. If the young people have guests the front of the house is
    yielded to them. For day is the time for the councils of old men and
    the labours of youth, and night is the time for lighter things. Two
    kinsmen, or a chief and his councillor, sit and gossip over the day’s
    events or make plans for the morrow. Outside a crier goes through the
    village announcing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span> that the communal breadfruit pit will be opened
    in the morning, or that the village will make a great fish trap. If it
    is moonlight, groups of young men, women by twos and threes, wander
    through the village, and crowds of children hunt for land crabs or
    chase each other among the breadfruit trees. Half the village may go
    fishing by torchlight and the curving reef will gleam with wavering
    lights and echo with shouts of triumph or disappointment, teasing
    words or smothered cries of outraged modesty. Or a group of youths may
    dance for the pleasure of some visiting maiden. Many of those who have
    retired to sleep, drawn by the merry music, will wrap their sheets
    about them and set out to find the dancing. A white-clad, ghostly
    throng will gather in a circle about the gaily lit house, a circle from
    which every now and then a few will detach themselves and wander away
    among the trees. Sometimes sleep will not descend upon the village
    until long past midnight; then at last there is only the mellow thunder
    of the reef and the whisper of lovers, as the village rests until dawn.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE EDUCATION OF THE SAMOAN CHILD</div>

  <p>Birthdays are of little account in Samoa. But for the birth itself of
    the baby of high rank, a great feast will be held, and much property
    given away. The first baby must always be born in the mother’s village
    and if she has gone to live in the village of her husband, she must go
    home for the occasion. For several months before the birth of the child
    the father’s relatives have brought gifts of food to the prospective
    mother, while the mother’s female relatives have been busy making pure
    white bark cloth for baby clothes and weaving dozens of tiny pandanus
    mats which form the layette. The expectant mother goes home laden
    with food gifts and when she returns to her husband’s family, her
    family provide her with the exact equivalent in mats and bark cloth
    as a gift to them. At the birth itself the father’s mother or sister
    must be present to care for the new-born baby while the midwife and
    the relatives of the mother care for her. There is no privacy about a
    birth. Convention dictates that the mother should neither writhe, nor
    cry out, nor inveigh against the presence of twenty or thirty people
    in the house who sit up all night if need be, laughing, joking, and
    playing games. The midwife cuts the cord with a fresh <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>bamboo knife
    and then all wait eagerly for the cord to fall off, the signal for a
    feast. If the baby is a girl, the cord is buried under a paper mulberry
    tree (the tree from which bark cloth is made) to ensure her growing up
    to be industrious at household tasks; for a boy it is thrown into the
    sea that he may be a skilled fisherman, or planted under a taro plant
    to give him industry in farming. Then the visitors go home, the mother
    rises and goes about her daily tasks, and the new baby ceases to be of
    much interest to any one. The day, the month in which it was born, is
    forgotten. Its first steps or first word are remarked without exuberant
    comment, without ceremony. It has lost all ceremonial importance and
    will not regain it again until after puberty; in most Samoan villages
    a girl will be ceremonially ignored until she is married. And even
    the mother remembers only that Losa is older than Tupu, and that her
    sister’s little boy, Fale, is younger than her brother’s child, Vigo.
    Relative age is of great importance, for the elder may always command
    the younger—until the positions of adult life upset the arrangement—but
    actual age may well be forgotten.</p>

  <p>Babies are always nursed, and in the few cases where the mother’s milk
    fails her, a wet nurse is sought among the kinsfolk. From the first
    week they are also given other food, papaya, cocoanut milk, sugar-cane
    juice; the food is either masticated by the mother and then put into
    the baby’s mouth on her finger, or if it is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>liquid, a piece of bark
    cloth is dipped into it and the child allowed to suck it, as shepherds
    feed orphaned lambs. The babies are nursed whenever they cry and there
    is no attempt at regularity. Unless a woman expects another child, she
    will nurse a baby until it is two or three years old, as the simplest
    device for pacifying its crying. Babies sleep with their mothers as
    long as they are at the breast; after weaning they are usually handed
    over to the care of some younger girl in the household. They are bathed
    frequently with the juice of a wild orange and rubbed with cocoanut oil
    until their skins glisten.</p>

  <p>The chief nurse-maid is usually a child of six or seven who is not
    strong enough to lift a baby over six months old, but who can carry
    the child straddling the left hip, or on the small of the back. A
    child of six or seven months of age will assume this straddling
    position naturally when it is picked up. Their diminutive nurses do
    not encourage children to walk, as babies who can walk about are more
    complicated charges. They walk before they talk, but it is impossible
    to give the age of walking with any exactness, though I saw two babies
    walk whom I knew to be only nine months old, and my impression is
    that the average age is about a year. The life on the floor, for all
    activities within a Samoan house are conducted on the floor, encourages
    crawling, and children under three or four years of age optionally
    crawl or walk.</p>

  <p>From birth until the age of four or five a child’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>education is
    exceedingly simple. They must be house-broken, a matter made more
    difficult by an habitual indifference to the activities of very small
    children. They must learn to sit or crawl within the house and never
    to stand upright unless it is absolutely necessary; never to address
    an adult in a standing position; to stay out of the sun; not to
    tangle the strands of the weaver; not to scatter the cut-up cocoanut
    which is spread out to dry; to keep their scant loin cloths at least
    nominally fastened to their persons; to treat fire and knives with
    proper caution; not to touch the kava bowl, or the kava cup; and,
    if their father is a chief, not to crawl on his bed-place when he
    is by. These are really simply a series of avoidances, enforced by
    occasional cuffings and a deal of exasperated shouting and ineffectual
    conversation.</p>

  <p>The weight of the punishment usually falls upon the next oldest child,
    who learns to shout, “Come out of the sun,” before she has fully
    appreciated the necessity of doing so herself. By the time Samoan girls
    and boys have reached sixteen or seventeen years of age these perpetual
    admonitions to the younger ones have become an inseparable part of
    their conversation, a monotonous, irritated undercurrent to all their
    comments. I have known them to intersperse their remarks every two
    or three minutes with, “Keep still,” “Sit still,” “Keep your mouths
    shut,” “Stop that noise,” uttered quite mechanically although all of
    the little ones present may have been behaving as quietly as a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>row
    of intimidated mice. On the whole, this last requirement of silence
    is continually mentioned and never enforced. The little nurses are
    more interested in peace than in forming the characters of their small
    charges and when a child begins to howl, it is simply dragged out of
    earshot of its elders. No mother will ever exert herself to discipline
    a younger child if an older one can be made responsible.</p>

  <p>If small families of parents and children prevailed in Samoa, this
    system would result in making half of the population solicitous and
    self-sacrificing and the other half tyrannous and self-indulgent.
    But just as a child is getting old enough so that its wilfulness is
    becoming unbearable, a younger one is saddled upon it, and the whole
    process is repeated again, each child being disciplined and socialised
    through responsibility for a still younger one.</p>

  <p>This fear of the disagreeable consequences resulting from a child’s
    crying, is so firmly fixed in the minds of the older children that long
    after there is any need for it, they succumb to some little tyrant’s
    threat of making a scene, and five-year-olds bully their way into
    expeditions on which they will have to be carried, into weaving parties
    where they will tangle the strands, and cook houses where they will
    tear up the cooking leaves or get thoroughly smudged with the soot
    and have to be washed—all because an older boy or girl has become so
    accustomed to yielding any point to stop an outcry. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>This method of
    giving in, coaxing, bribing, diverting the infant disturbers is only
    pursued within the household or the relationship group, where there
    are duly constituted elders in authority to punish the older children
    who can’t keep the babies still. Towards a neighbour’s children or in
    a crowd the half-grown girls and boys and even the adults vent their
    full irritation upon the heads of troublesome children. If a crowd of
    children are near enough, pressing in curiously to watch some spectacle
    at which they are not wanted, they are soundly lashed with palm leaves,
    or dispersed with a shower of small stones, of which the house floor
    always furnishes a ready supply. This treatment does not seem actually
    to improve the children’s behaviour, but merely to make them cling
    even closer to their frightened and indulgent little guardians. It
    may be surmised that stoning the children from next door provides a
    most necessary outlet for those who have spent so many weary hours
    placating their own young relatives. And even these bursts of anger are
    nine-tenths gesture. No one who throws the stones actually means to hit
    a child, but the children know that if they repeat their intrusions
    too often, by the laws of chance some of the flying bits of coral
    will land in their faces. Even Samoan dogs have learned to estimate
    the proportion of gesture that there is in a Samoan’s “get out of the
    house.” They simply stalk out between one set of posts and with equal
    dignity and all casualness stalk in at the next opening. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>By the time a
    child is six or seven she has all the essential avoidances well enough
    by heart to be trusted with the care of a younger child. And she also
    develops a number of simple techniques. She learns to weave firm square
    balls from palm leaves, to make pin-wheels of palm leaves or frangipani
    blossoms, to climb a cocoanut tree by walking up the trunk on flexible
    little feet, to break open a cocoanut with one firm well-directed blow
    of a knife as long as she is tall, to play a number of group games and
    sing the songs which go with them, to tidy the house by picking up the
    litter on the stony floor, to bring water from the sea, to spread out
    the copra to dry and to help gather it in when rain threatens, to roll
    the pandanus leaves for weaving, to go to a neighbouring house and
    bring back a lighted fagot for the chief’s pipe or the cook-house fire,
    and to exercise tact in begging slight favours from relatives.</p>

  <p>But in the case of the little girls all of these tasks are merely
    supplementary to the main business of baby-tending. Very small boys
    also have some care of the younger children, but at eight or nine years
    of age they are usually relieved of it. Whatever rough edges have not
    been smoothed off by this responsibility for younger children are worn
    off by their contact with older boys. For little boys are admitted to
    interesting and important activities only so long as their behaviour
    is circumspect and helpful. Where small girls are brusquely pushed
    aside, small boys will be patiently tolerated and they become adept at
    making themselves useful. The four <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>or five little boys who all wish to
    assist at the important business of helping a grown youth lasso reef
    eels, organise themselves into a highly efficient working team; one
    boy holds the bait, another holds an extra lasso, others poke eagerly
    about in holes in the reef looking for prey, while still another tucks
    the captured eels into his <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>. The small girls, burdened
    with heavy babies or the care of little staggerers who are too small to
    adventure on the reef, discouraged by the hostility of the small boys
    and the scorn of the older ones, have little opportunity for learning
    the more adventurous forms of work and play. So while the little boys
    first undergo the chastening effects of baby-tending and then have many
    opportunities to learn effective co-operation under the supervision
    of older boys, the girls’ education is less comprehensive. They
    have a high standard of individual responsibility but the community
    provides them with no lessons in co-operation with one another. This
    is particularly apparent in the activities of young people; the boys
    organise quickly; the girls waste hours in bickering, innocent of any
    technique for quick and efficient co-operation.</p>

  <p>And as the woman who goes fishing can only get away by turning the
    babies over to the little girls of the household, the little girls
    cannot accompany their aunts and mothers. So they learn even the simple
    processes of reef fishing much later than do the boys. They are kept at
    the baby-tending, errand-running stage until they are old enough and
    robust enough to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>work on the plantations and carry foodstuffs down to
    the village.</p>

  <p>A girl is given these more strenuous tasks near the age of puberty,
    but it is purely a question of her physical size and ability to take
    responsibility, rather than of her physical maturity. Before this time
    she has occasionally accompanied the older members of the family to the
    plantations if they were willing to take the babies along also. But
    once there, while her brothers and cousins are collecting cocoanuts and
    roving happily about in the bush, she has again to chase and shepherd
    and pacify the ubiquitous babies.</p>

  <p>As soon as the girls are strong enough to carry heavy loads, it pays
    the family to shift the responsibility for the little children to the
    younger girls and the adolescent girls are released from baby-tending.
    It may be said with some justice that the worst period of their lives
    is over. Never again will they be so incessantly at the beck and
    call of their elders, never again so tyrannised over by two-year-old
    tyrants. All the irritating, detailed routine of housekeeping, which
    in our civilisation is accused of warping the souls and souring the
    tempers of grown women, is here performed by children under fourteen
    years of age. A fire or a pipe to be kindled, a call for a drink,
    a lamp to be lit, the baby’s cry, the errand of the capricious
    adult—these haunt them from morning until night. With the introduction
    of several months a year of government schools these children are
    being taken out of their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>homes for most of the day. This brings about
    a complete disorganisation of the native households which have no
    precedents for a manner of life where mothers have to stay at home and
    take care of their children and adults have to perform small routine
    tasks and run errands.</p>

  <p>Before their release from baby-tending the little girls have a very
    limited knowledge of any of the more complicated techniques. Some of
    them can do the simpler work in preparing food for cooking, such as
    skinning bananas, grating cocoanuts, or scraping taro. A few of them
    can weave the simple carrying basket. But now they must learn to weave
    all their own baskets for carrying supplies; learn to select taro
    leaves of the right age for cooking, to dig only mature taro. In the
    cook-house they learn to make <i lang="sm">palusami</i>, to grate the cocoanut
    meat, season it with hot stones, mix it with sea water and strain
    out the husks, pour this milky mixture into a properly made little
    container of taro leaves from which the aromatic stem has been scorched
    off, wrap these in a breadfruit leaf and fasten the stem tightly to
    make a durable cooking jacket. They must learn to lace a large fish
    into a palm leaf, or roll a bundle of small fish in a breadfruit
    leaf; to select the right kind of leaves for stuffing a pig, to judge
    when the food in the oven of small heated stones is thoroughly baked.
    Theoretically the bulk of the cooking is done by the boys and where a
    girl has to do the heavier work, it is a matter for comment: <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>“Poor
    Losa, there are no boys in her house and always she must make the
    oven.” But the girls always help and often do a great part of the work.</p>

  <p>Once they are regarded as individuals who can devote a long period
    of time to some consecutive activity, girls are sent on long fishing
    expeditions. They learn to weave fish baskets, to gather and arrange
    the bundles of fagots used in torch-light fishing, to tickle a devil
    fish until it comes out of its hole and climbs obediently upon the
    waiting stick, appropriately dubbed a “come hither stick”; to string
    the great rose-coloured jellyfish, <i lang="sm">lole</i>, a name which Samoan
    children give to candy also, on a long string of hibiscus bark,
    tipped with a palm leaf rib for a needle; to know good fish from bad
    fish, fish that are in season from fish which are dangerous at some
    particular time of the year; and never to take two octopuses, found
    paired on a rock, lest bad luck come upon the witless fisher.</p>

  <p>Before this time their knowledge of plants and trees is mainly a play
    one, the pandanus provides them with seeds for necklaces, the palm
    tree with leaves to weave balls; the banana tree gives leaves for
    umbrellas and half a leaf to shred into a stringy “choker”; cocoanut
    shells cut in half, with cinet strings attached, make a species of
    stilt; the blossoms of the <i lang="sm">Pua</i> tree can be sewed into beautiful
    necklaces. Now they must learn to recognise these trees and plants for
    more serious purposes; they must learn when the pandanus leaves are
    ready for the cutting and how to cut the long leaves <span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>with one sure
    quick stroke; they must distinguish between the three kinds of pandanus
    used for different grades of mats. The pretty orange seeds which made
    such attractive and also edible necklaces must now be gathered as
    paint brushes for ornamenting bark cloth. Banana leaves are gathered
    to protect the woven platters, to wrap up puddings for the oven, to
    bank the steaming oven full of food. Banana bark must be stripped at
    just the right point to yield the even, pliant, black strips, needed to
    ornament mats and baskets. Bananas themselves must be distinguished as
    to those which are ripe for burying, or the golden curved banana ready
    for eating, or bananas ready to be sun-dried for making fruit-cake
    rolls. Hibiscus bark can no longer be torn off at random to give a
    raffia-like string for a handful of shells; long journeys must be made
    inland to select bark of the right quality for use in weaving.</p>

  <p>In the house the girl’s principal task is to learn to weave. She has
    to master several different techniques. First, she learns to weave
    palm branches where the central rib of the leaf serves as a rim to
    her basket or an edge to her mat and where the leaflets are already
    arranged for weaving. From palm leaves she first learns to weave
    a carrying basket, made of half a leaf, by plaiting the leaflets
    together and curving the rib into a rim. Then she learns to weave the
    Venetian blinds which hang between the house posts, by laying one-half
    leaf upon another and plaiting the leaflets together. More difficult
    are the floor mats, woven of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>four great palm leaves, and the food
    platters with their intricate designs. There are also fans to make,
    simple two-strand weaves which she learns to make quite well, more
    elaborate twined ones which are the prerogative of older and more
    skilled weavers. Usually some older woman in the household trains a
    girl to weave and sees to it that she makes at least one of each kind
    of article, but she is only called upon to produce in quantity the
    simpler things, like the Venetian blinds. From the pandanus she learns
    to weave the common floor mats, one or two types of the more elaborate
    bed mats, and then, when she is thirteen or fourteen, she begins her
    first fine mat. The fine mat represents the high point of Samoan
    weaving virtuosity. Woven of the finest quality of pandanus which has
    been soaked and baked and scraped to a golden whiteness and paper-like
    thinness, of strands a sixteenth of an inch in width, these mats take
    a year or two years to weave and are as soft and pliable as linen.
    They form the unit of value, and must always be included in the dowry
    of the bride. Girls seldom finish a fine mat until they are nineteen
    or twenty, but the mat has been started, and, wrapped up in a coarser
    one, it rests among the rafters, a testimony to the girl’s industry
    and manual skill. She learns the rudiments of bark cloth making; she
    can select and cut the paper mulberry wands, peel off the bark, beat
    it after it has been scraped by more expert hands. The patterning of
    the cloth with a pattern <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>board or by free hand drawing is left for the
    more experienced adult.</p>

  <p>Throughout this more or less systematic period of education, the girls
    maintain a very nice balance between a reputation for the necessary
    minimum of knowledge and a virtuosity which would make too heavy
    demands. A girl’s chances of marriage are badly damaged if it gets
    about the village that she is lazy and inept in domestic tasks. But
    after these first stages have been completed the girl marks time
    technically for three or four years. She does the routine weaving,
    especially of the Venetian blinds and carrying baskets. She helps
    with the plantation work and the cooking, she weaves a very little on
    her fine mat. But she thrusts virtuosity away from her as she thrusts
    away every other sort of responsibility with the invariable comment,
    “Laititi a’u” (“I am but young”). All of her interest is expended on
    clandestine sex adventures, and she is content to do routine tasks as,
    to a certain extent, her brother is also.</p>

  <p>But the seventeen-year-old boy is not left passively to his own
    devices. He has learned the rudiments of fishing, he can take a dug-out
    canoe over the reef safely, or manage the stern paddle in a bonito
    boat. He can plant taro or transplant cocoanut, husk cocoanuts on a
    stake and cut the meat out with one deft quick turn of the knife. Now
    at seventeen or eighteen he is thrust into the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, the
    society of the young <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>men and the older men without titles, the group
    that is called, not in euphemism but in sober fact, “the strength of
    the village.” Here he is badgered into efficiency by rivalry, precept
    and example. The older chiefs who supervise the activities of the
    <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> gaze equally sternly upon any backslidings and upon any
    undue precocity. The prestige of his group is ever being called into
    account by the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> of the neighbouring villages. His fellows
    ridicule and persecute the boy who fails to appear when any group
    activity is on foot, whether work for the village on the plantations,
    or fishing, or cooking for the chiefs, or play in the form of a
    ceremonial call upon some visiting maiden. Furthermore, the youth
    is given much more stimulus to learn and also a greater variety of
    occupations are open to him. There is no specialisation among women,
    except in medicine and mid-wifery, both the prerogatives of very old
    women who teach their arts to their middle-aged daughters and nieces.
    The only other vocation is that of the wife of an official orator,
    and no girl will prepare herself for this one type of marriage which
    demands special knowledge, for she has no guarantee that she will marry
    a man of this class.</p>

  <p>For the boy it is different. He hopes that some day he will hold
    a <i lang="sm">matai</i> name, a name which will make him a member of the
    <i lang="sm">Fono</i>, the assembly of headmen, which will give him a right to
    drink kava with chiefs, to work with chiefs rather than with the young
    men, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>to sit inside the house, even though his new title is only of
    “between the posts” rank, and not of enough importance to give him a
    right to a post for his back. But very seldom is he absolutely assured
    of getting such a name. Each family hold several of these titles
    which they confer upon the most promising youths in the whole family
    connection. He has many rivals. They also are in the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>.
    He must always pit himself against them in the group activities.
    There are also several types of activities in one of which he must
    specialise. He must become a house-builder, a fisherman, an orator
    or a wood carver. Proficiency in some technique must set him off a
    little from his fellows. Fishing prowess means immediate rewards in
    the shape of food gifts to offer to his sweetheart; without such gifts
    his advances will be scorned. Skill in house-building means wealth and
    status, for a young man who is a skilled carpenter must be treated as
    courteously as a chief and addressed with the chief’s language, the
    elaborate set of honorific words used to people of rank. And with this
    goes the continual demand that he should not be too efficient, too
    outstanding, too precocious. He must never excel his fellows by more
    than a little. He must neither arouse their hatred nor the disapproval
    of his elders who are far readier to encourage and excuse the laggard
    than to condone precocity. And at the same time he shares his sister’s
    reluctance to accept responsibility, and if he should excel gently, not
    too obviously, he has good <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>chances of being made a chief. If he is
    sufficiently talented, the <i lang="sm">Fono</i> itself may deliberate, search
    out a vacant title to confer upon him and call him in that he may sit
    with the old men and learn wisdom. And yet so well recognised is the
    unwillingness of the young men to respond to this honour, that the
    provision is always made, “And if the young man runs away, then never
    shall he be made a chief, but always he must sit outside the house with
    the young men, preparing and serving the food of the <i lang="sm">matais</i>
    with whom he may not sit in the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>.” Still more pertinent
    are the chances of his relationship group bestowing a <i lang="sm">matai</i>
    name upon the gifted young man. And a <i lang="sm">matai</i> he wishes to be,
    some day, some far-off day when his limbs have lost a little of their
    suppleness and his heart the love of fun and of dancing. As one chief
    of twenty-seven told me: “I have been a chief only four years and look,
    my hair is grey, although in Samoa grey hair comes very slowly, not in
    youth, as it comes to the white man. But always, I must act as if I
    were old. I must walk gravely and with a measured step. I may not dance
    except upon most solemn occasions, neither may I play games with the
    young men. Old men of sixty are my companions and watch my every word,
    lest I make a mistake. Thirty-one people live in my household. For them
    I must plan, I must find them food and clothing, settle their disputes,
    arrange their marriages. There is no one in my whole family who dares
    to scold me or even to address me familiarly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>by my first name. It is
    hard to be so young and yet to be a chief.” And the old men shake their
    heads and agree that it is unseemly for one to be a chief so young.</p>

  <p>The operation of natural ambition is further vitiated by the fact that
    the young man who is made a <i lang="sm">matai</i> will not be the greatest among
    his former associates, but the youngest and greenest member of the
    <i lang="sm">Fono</i>. And no longer may he associate familiarly with his old
    companions; a <i lang="sm">matai</i> must associate only with <i lang="sm">matais</i>, must
    work beside them in the bush and sit and talk quietly with them in the
    evening.</p>

  <p>And so the boy is faced by a far more difficult dilemma than the girl.
    He dislikes responsibility, but he wishes to excel in his group; skill
    will hasten the day when he is made a chief, yet he receives censure
    and ridicule if he slackens his efforts; but he will be scolded if he
    proceeds too rapidly; yet if he would win a sweetheart, he must have
    prestige among his fellows. And conversely, his social prestige is
    increased by his amorous exploits.</p>

  <p>So while the girl rests upon her “pass” proficiency, the boy is spurred
    to greater efforts. A boy is shy of a girl who does not have these
    proofs of efficiency and is known to be stupid and unskilled; he is
    afraid he may come to want to marry her. Marrying a girl without
    proficiency would be a most imprudent step and involve an endless
    amount of wrangling with his family. So the girl who is notoriously
    inept must take her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>lovers from among the casual, the jaded, and the
    married who are no longer afraid that their senses will betray them
    into an imprudent marriage.</p>

  <p>But the seventeen-year-old girl does not wish to marry—not yet. It is
    better to live as a girl with no responsibility, and a rich variety
    of emotional experience. This is the best period of her life. There
    are as many beneath her whom she may bully as there are others above
    her to tyrannise over her. What she loses in prestige, she gains in
    freedom. She has very little baby-tending to do. Her eyes do not ache
    from weaving nor does her back break from bending all day over the tapa
    board. The long expeditions after fish and food and weaving materials
    give ample opportunities for rendezvous. Proficiency would mean more
    work, more confining work, and earlier marriage, and marriage is the
    inevitable to be deferred as long as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="Chapter_IV">IV</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">THE SAMOAN HOUSEHOLD</div>

  <p>A Samoan village is made up of some thirty to forty households, each
    of which is presided over by a headman called a <i lang="sm">matai</i>. These
    headmen hold either chiefly titles or the titles of talking chiefs,
    who are the official orators, spokesmen and ambassadors of chiefs.
    In a formal village assembly each <i lang="sm">matai</i> has his place, and
    represents and is responsible for all the members of his household.
    These households include all the individuals who live for any length of
    time under the authority and protection of a common <i lang="sm">matai</i>. Their
    composition varies from the biological family consisting of parents
    and children only, to households of fifteen and twenty people who are
    all related to the <i lang="sm">matai</i> or to his wife by blood, marriage or
    adoption, but who often have no close relationship to each other. The
    adopted members of a household are usually but not necessarily distant
    relatives.</p>

  <p>Widows and widowers, especially when they are childless, usually
    return to their blood relatives, but a married couple may live with
    the relatives of either one. Such a household is not necessarily a
    close residential unit, but may be scattered over the village in
    three or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>four houses. No one living permanently in another village
    is counted as a member of the household, which is strictly a local
    unit. Economically, the household is also a unit, for all work upon
    the plantations under the supervision of the <i lang="sm">matai</i> who in turn
    parcels out to them food and other necessities.</p>

  <p>Within the household, age rather than relationship gives disciplinary
    authority. The <i lang="sm">matai</i> exercises nominal and usually real
    authority over every individual under his protection, even over his
    father and mother. This control is, of course, modified by personality
    differences, always carefully tempered, however, by a ceremonious
    acknowledgment of his position. The newest baby born into such a
    household is subject to every individual in it, and his position
    improves no whit with age until a younger child appears upon the scene.
    But in most households the position of youngest is a highly temporary
    one. Nieces and nephews or destitute young cousins come to swell the
    ranks of the household and at adolescence a girl stands virtually in
    the middle with as many individuals who must obey her as there are
    persons to whom she owes obedience. Where increased efficiency and
    increased self-consciousness would perhaps have made her obstreperous
    and restless in a differently organised family, here she has ample
    outlet for a growing sense of authority.</p>

  <p>This development is perfectly regular. A girl’s marriage makes a minimum
    of difference in this respect, except in so far as her own children
    increase <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>most pertinently the supply of agreeably docile subordinates.
    But the girls who remain unmarried even beyond their early twenties are
    in nowise less highly regarded or less responsible than their married
    sisters. This tendency to make the classifying principle age, rather
    than married state, is reinforced outside the home by the fact that the
    wives of untitled men and all unmarried girls past puberty are classed
    together in the ceremonial organisation of the village.</p>

  <p>Relatives in other households also play a rôle in the children’s lives.
    Any older relative has a right to demand personal service from younger
    relatives, a right to criticise their conduct and to interfere in their
    affairs. Thus a little girl may escape alone down to the beach to bathe
    only to be met by an older cousin who sets her washing or caring for
    a baby or to fetch some cocoanut to scrub the clothes. So closely is
    the daily life bound up with this universal servitude and so numerous
    are the acknowledged relationships in the name of which service can be
    exacted, that for the children an hour’s escape from surveillance is
    almost impossible.</p>

  <p>This loose but demanding relationship group has its compensations also.
    Within it a child of three can wander safely and come to no harm, can
    be sure of finding food and drink, a sheet to wrap herself up in for
    a nap, a kind hand to dry casual tears and bind up her wounds. Any
    small children who are missing when night falls, are simply “sought
    among their kinsfolk,” and a baby whose mother has gone inland to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>work
    on the plantation is passed from hand to hand for the length of the
    village.</p>

  <p>The ranking by age is disturbed in only a few cases. In each village
    one or two high chiefs have the hereditary right to name some girl
    of their household as its <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, the ceremonial princess of
    the house. The girl who at fifteen or sixteen is made a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>
    is snatched from her age group and sometimes from her immediate
    family also and surrounded by a glare of prestige. The older women of
    the village accord her courtesy titles, her immediate family often
    exploits her position for their personal ends and in return show great
    consideration for her wishes. But as there are only two or three
    <i lang="sm">taupos</i> in a village, their unique position serves to emphasise
    rather than to disprove the general status of young girls.</p>

  <p>Coupled with this enormous diffusion of authority goes a fear of
    overstraining the relationship bond, which expresses itself in an
    added respect for personality. The very number of her captors is the
    girl’s protection, for does one press her too far, she has but to
    change her residence to the home of some more complacent relative. It
    is possible to classify the different households open to her as those
    with hardest work, least chaperonage, least scolding, largest or least
    number of contemporaries, fewest babies, best food, etc. Few children
    live continuously in one household, but are always testing out other
    possible residences. And this can be done under the guise of visits
    and with <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>no suggestion of truancy. But the minute that the mildest
    annoyance grows up at home, the possibility of flight moderates the
    discipline and alleviates the child’s sense of dependency. No Samoan
    child, except the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, or the thoroughly delinquent, ever has
    to deal with a feeling of being trapped. There are always relatives to
    whom one can flee. This is the invariable answer which a Samoan gives
    when some familial impasse is laid before him. “But she will go to
    some <em>other</em> relative.” And theoretically the supply of relatives
    is inexhaustible. Unless the vagrant has committed some very serious
    offence like incest, it is only necessary formally to depart from the
    bosom of one’s household. A girl whose father has beaten her over
    severely in the morning will be found living in haughty sanctuary,
    two hundred feet away, in a different household. So cherished is
    this system of consanguineous refuge, that an untitled man or a man
    of lesser rank will beard the nobler relative who comes to demand
    a runaway child. With great politeness and endless expressions of
    conciliation, he will beg his noble chief to return to his noble home
    and remain there quietly until his noble anger is healed against his
    noble child.</p>

  <p>The most important relationships<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> within a Samoan household which
    influence the lives of the young people are the relationships between
    the boys and girls who call each other “brother” and “sister,” whether
    by blood, marriage or adoption, and the relationship between younger
    and older relatives. The stress upon <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>the sex difference between
    contemporaries and the emphasis on relative age are amply explained by
    the conditions of family life. Relatives of opposite sex have a most
    rigid code of etiquette prescribed for all their contacts with each
    other. After they have reached years of discretion, nine or ten years
    of age in this case, they may not touch each other, sit close together,
    eat together, address each other familiarly, or mention any salacious
    matter in each other’s presence. They may not remain in any house,
    except their own, together, unless half the village is gathered there.
    They may not walk together, use each other’s possessions, dance on the
    same floor, or take part in any of the same small group activities.
    This strict avoidance applies to all individuals of the opposite sex
    within five years above or below one’s own age with whom one was reared
    or to whom one acknowledges relationship by blood or marriage. The
    conformance to this brother and sister taboo begins when the younger
    of the two children feels “ashamed” at the elder’s touch and continues
    until old age when the decrepit, toothless pair of old siblings may
    again sit on the same mat and not feel ashamed.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> See Appendix, <a href="#Page_249">page 249</a>.
  </div>

  <p><i lang="sm">Tei</i>, the word for younger relative, stresses the other most
    emotionally charged relationship. The first maternal enthusiasm of a
    girl is never expended upon her own children but upon some younger
    relative. And it is the girls and women who use this term most,
    continuing to cherish it after they and the younger ones <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>to whom
    it is applied are full grown. The younger child in turn expends its
    enthusiasm upon a still younger one without manifesting any excessive
    affection for the fostering elders.</p>

  <p>The word <i lang="sm">aiga</i> is used roughly to cover all relationships by
    blood, marriage and adoption, and the emotional tone seems to be the
    same in each case. Relationship by marriage is counted only as long
    as an actual marriage connects two kinship groups. If the marriage is
    broken in any way, by desertion, divorce, or death, the relationship
    is dissolved and members of the two families are free to marry each
    other. If the marriage left any children, a reciprocal relationship
    exists between the two households as long as the child lives, for the
    mother’s family will always have to contribute one kind of property,
    the father’s family another, for occasions when property must be given
    away in the name of the child.</p>

  <p>A relative is regarded as some one upon whom one has a multitude of
    claims and to whom one owes a multitude of obligations. From a relative
    one may demand food, clothing, and shelter, or assistance in a feud.
    Refusal of such a demand brands one as stingy and lacking in human
    kindness, the virtue most esteemed among the Samoans. No definite
    repayment is made at the time such services are given, except in the
    case of the distribution of food to all those who share in a family
    enterprise. But careful count of the value of the property given and
    of the service rendered is kept and a <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>return gift demanded at the
    earliest opportunity. Nevertheless, in native theory the two acts
    are separate, each one in turn becoming a “beggar,” a pensioner upon
    another’s bounty. In olden times, the beggar sometimes wore a special
    girdle which delicately hinted at the cause of his visit. One old chief
    gave me a graphic description of the behaviour of some one who had come
    to ask a favour of a relative. “He will come early in the morning and
    enter quietly, sitting down in the very back of the house, in the place
    of least honour. You will say to him, ‘So you have come, be welcome!’
    and he will answer, ‘I have come indeed, saving your noble presence.’
    Then you will say, ‘Are you thirsty? Alas for your coming, there is
    little that is good within the house.’ And he will answer, ‘Let it
    rest, thank you, for indeed I am not hungry nor would I drink.’ And
    he will sit and you will sit all day long and no mention is made of
    the purpose of his coming. All day he will sit and brush the ashes out
    of the hearth, performing this menial and dirty task with very great
    care and attention. If some one must go inland to the plantation to
    fetch food, he is the first to offer to go. If some one must go fishing
    to fill out the crew of a canoe, surely he is delighted to go, even
    though the sun is hot and his journey hither has been long. And all day
    you sit and wonder, ‘What can it be that he has come for? Is it that
    largest pig that he wants, or has he heard perhaps that my daughter has
    just finished a large and beautiful <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>piece of tapa? Would it perhaps
    be well to send that tapa, as I had perhaps planned, as a present to
    my talking chief, to send it now, so that I may refuse him with all
    good faith?’ And he sits and studies your countenance and wonders if
    you will be favourable to his request. He plays with the children but
    refuses the necklace of flowers which they have woven for him and
    gives it instead to your daughter. Finally night comes. It is time to
    sleep and still he has not spoken. So finally you say to him, ‘Lo, I
    would sleep. Will you sleep also or will you be returning whence you
    have come?’ And only then will he speak and tell you the desire in his
    heart.”</p>

  <p>So the intrigue, the needs, the obligations of the larger relationship
    group which threads its carefully remembered way in and out of many
    houses and many villages, cuts across the life of the household. One
    day it is the wife’s relatives who come to spend a month or borrow a
    fine mat; the next day it is the husband’s; the third, a niece who is a
    valued worker in the household may be called home by the illness of her
    father. Very seldom do all of even the small children of a biological
    family live in one household and while the claims of the household are
    paramount, in the routine of everyday life, illness or need on the part
    of the closer relative in another household will call the wanderers
    home again.</p>

  <p>Obligations either to give general assistance or to give specific
    traditionally required service, as in a marriage <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>or at a birth, follow
    relationship lines, not household lines. But a marriage of many years’
    duration binds the relationship groups of husband and wife so closely
    together that to all appearances it is the household unit which gives
    aid and accedes to a request brought by the relative of either one.
    Only in families of high rank where the distaff side has priority in
    decisions and in furnishing the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, the princess of the
    house, and the male line priority in holding the title, does the
    actual blood relationship continue to be a matter of great practical
    importance; and this importance is lost in the looser household group
    constituted as it is by the three principles of blood, marriage and
    adoption, and bound together by common ties of everyday living and
    mutual economic dependence.</p>

  <p>The <i lang="sm">matai</i> of a household is theoretically exempt from the
    performance of small domestic tasks, but he is seldom actually so
    except in the case of a chief of high rank. However, the leading rôle
    is always accorded to him in any industrial pursuit; he dresses the pig
    for the feasts and cuts up the cocoanuts which the boys and women have
    gathered. The family cooking is done by the men and women both, but the
    bulk of the work falls upon the boys and young men. The old men spin
    the cocoanut fibre, and braid it into the native cord which is used for
    fish lines, fish nets, to sew canoe parts together and to bind all the
    different parts of a house in place. With the old women who do the bulk
    of the weaving and making of bark cloth, they supervise <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>the younger
    children who remain at home. The heavy routine agricultural work falls
    upon the women who are responsible for the weeding, transplanting,
    gathering and transportation of the food, and the gathering of the
    paper mulberry wands from which bark will be peeled for making tapa,
    of the hibiscus bark and pandanus leaves for weaving mats. The older
    girls and women also do the routine reef fishing for octopuses, sea
    eggs, jelly fish, crabs, and other small fry. The younger girls carry
    the water, care for the lamps (to-day except in times of great scarcity
    when the candle nut and cocoanut oil are resorted to, the natives use
    kerosene lamps and lanterns), and sweep and arrange the houses. Tasks
    are all graduated with a fair recognition of abilities which differ
    with age, and except in the case of individuals of very high rank, a
    task is rejected because a younger person has skill enough to perform
    it, rather than because it is beneath an adult’s dignity.</p>

  <p>Rank in the village and rank in the household reflect each other, but
    village rank hardly affects the young children. If a girl’s father is
    a <i lang="sm">matai</i>, the <i lang="sm">matai</i> of the household in which she lives,
    she has no appeal from his authority. But if some other member of the
    family is the <i lang="sm">matai</i>, he and his wife may protect her from her
    father’s exactions. In the first case, disagreement with her father
    means leaving the household and going to live with other relatives;
    in the second case it may mean only a little internal friction. Also
    in the family <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>of a high chief or a high talking chief there is more
    emphasis upon ceremonial, more emphasis upon hospitality. The children
    are better bred and also much harder worked. But aside from the general
    quality of a household which is dependent upon the rank of its head,
    households of very different rank may seem very similar to young
    children. They are usually more concerned with the temperament of those
    in authority than with their rank. An uncle in another village who is
    a very high chief is of much less significance in a child’s life than
    some old woman in her own household who has a frightful temper.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, rank not of birth but of title is very important in
    Samoa. The status of a village depends upon the rank of its high chief,
    the prestige of a household depends upon the title of its <i lang="sm">matai</i>.
    Titles are of two grades, chiefs and talking chiefs, each title carries
    many other duties and prerogatives besides the headship of a household.
    And the Samoans find rank a never-failing source of interest. They have
    invented an elaborate courtesy language which must be used to people of
    rank; complicated etiquette surrounds each rank in society. Something
    which concerns their elders so nearly cannot help being indirectly
    reflected in the lives of some of the children. This is particularly
    true of the relationship of children to each other in households which
    hold titles to which some of them will one day attain. How these
    far-away issues of adult life affect the lives of children and young
    people can best <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>be understood by following their influence in the
    lives of particular children.</p>

  <p>In the household of a high chief named Malae lived two little girls,
    Meta, twelve, and Timu, eleven. Meta was a self-possessed, efficient
    little girl. Malae had taken her from her mother’s house—her mother was
    his cousin—because she showed unusual intelligence and precocity. Timu,
    on the other hand, was an abnormally shy, backward child, below her
    age group in intelligence. But Meta’s mother was only a distant cousin
    of Malae. Had she not married into a strange village where Malae was
    living temporarily, Meta might never have come actively to the notice
    of her noble relative. And Timu was the only daughter of Malae’s dead
    sister. Her father had been a quarter caste which served to mark her
    off and increase her self-consciousness. Dancing was an agony to her.
    She fled precipitately from an elder’s admonitory voice. But Timu would
    be Malae’s next <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, princess. She was pretty, the principal
    recognised qualification, and she came from the distaff side of the
    house, the preferred descent for a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. So Meta, the more
    able in every way, was pushed to the wall, and Timu, miserable over
    the amount of attention she received, was dragged forward. The mere
    presence of another more able and enterprising child would probably
    have emphasised Timu’s feeling of inferiority, but this publicity
    stressed it painfully. Commanded to dance on every occasion, she
    would pause whenever she caught <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>an onlooker’s eye and stand a moment
    wringing her hands before going on with the dance.</p>

  <p>In another household, this same title of Malae’s <i lang="sm">taupo</i> played a
    different rôle. This was in the household of Malae’s paternal aunt who
    lived with her husband in Malae’s guest house in his native village.
    Her eldest daughter, Pana, held the title of <i lang="sm">taupo</i> of the house
    of Malae. But Pana was twenty-six, though still unmarried. She must
    be wedded soon and then another girl must be found to hold the title.
    Timu would still be too young. Pana had three younger sisters who
    by birth were supremely eligible to the title. But Mele, the eldest
    of twenty, was lame, and Pepe of fourteen was blind in one eye and
    an incorrigible tomboy. The youngest was even younger than Timu. So
    all three were effectually barred from succession. This fact reacted
    favourably upon the position of Filita. She was a seventeen-year-old
    niece of the father of the other children with no possible claims on a
    title in the house of Malae, but she had lived with her cousins since
    childhood. Filita was pretty, efficient, adequate, neither lame like
    Mele nor blind and hoydenish like Pepe. True she could never hope to
    be <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, but neither could they, despite their superior birth,
    so peace and amity reigned because of her cousins’ deficiencies. Still
    another little girl came within the circle of influence of the title.
    This was Pula, another little cousin in a third village. But her more
    distant relationship and possible claims were completely obscured <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>by
    the fact that she was the only granddaughter of the highest chief in
    her own village and her becoming the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> of that title was
    inevitable so that her life was untouched by any other possibility.
    Thus six girls in addition to the present <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, were influenced
    for good or evil by the possibility of succession to the title. But as
    there are seldom more than one or two <i lang="sm">taupos</i> in a village, these
    influences are still fairly circumscribed when compared with the part
    which rank plays in the lives of boys, for there are usually one or
    more <i lang="sm">matai</i> names in every relationship group.</p>

  <figure class="illowp66">
    <img src="images/i_052.jpg" alt="" id="i_052">
    <figcaption><i>A chief’s daughter and the baby of the household
      whose yellow hair will some day make a chief’s headdress</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>Rivalry plays a much stronger part here. In the choice of the
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and the <i lang="sm">manaia</i> (the titular heir-apparent) there
    is a strong prejudice in favour of blood relationship and also for
    the choice of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> from the female and the <i lang="sm">manaia</i>
    from the male line. But in the interests of efficiency this scheme
    had been modified, so that most titles were filled by the most able
    youth from the whole relationship and affinity group. So it was in
    Alofi. Tui, a chief of importance in the village, had one son, an
    able intelligent boy. Tui’s brothers were dull and inept, no fit
    successors to the title. One of them had an ill-favoured young son,
    a stupid, unattractive youngster. There were no other males in the
    near relationship group. It was assumed that the exceedingly eligible
    son would succeed his father. And then at twenty he died. The little
    nephew hardly gave promise of a satisfactory development, and so Tui
    had his choice of looking outside his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>village or outside of his near
    relationship group. Village feeling runs high in Tui’s village. Tui’s
    blood relatives lived many villages away. They were strangers. If he
    did not go to them and search for a promising youth whom he could train
    as his successor, he must either find an eligible young husband for
    his daughter or look among his wife’s people. Provisionally he took
    this last course, and his wife’s brother’s son came to live in his
    household. In a year, his new father promised the boy, he might assume
    his dead cousin’s name if he showed himself worthy.</p>

  <p>In the family of high chief Fua a very different problem presented
    itself. His was the highest title in the village. He was over sixty and
    the question of succession was a moot one. The boys in his household
    consisted of Tata, his eldest son who was illegitimate, Molo and Nua,
    the sons of his widowed sister, Sisi, his son by his first legal wife
    (since divorced and remarried on another island), and Tuai, the husband
    of his niece, the sister of Molo and Nua. And in the house of Fua’s
    eldest brother lived his brother’s daughter’s son, Alo, a youth of
    great promise. Here then were enough claimants to produce a lively
    rivalry. Tuai was the oldest, calm, able, but not sufficiently hopeful
    to be influenced in his conduct except as it made him more ready to
    assert the claims of superior age over his wife’s younger brothers
    whose claims were better than his. Next in age came Tata, the sour,
    beetle-browed bastard, whose chances were negligible <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>as long as there
    were those of legitimate birth to dispute his left-handed claims. But
    Tata did not lose hope. Cautious, tortuous-minded, he watched and
    waited. He was in love with Lotu, the daughter of a talking chief of
    only medium rank. For one of Fua’s sons, Lotu would have been a good
    match. But as Fua’s bastard who wished to be chief, he must marry high
    or not at all. The two nephews, Molo and Nua, played different hands.
    Nua, the younger, went away to seek his fortune as a native marine
    at the Naval Station. This meant a regular income, some knowledge of
    English, prestige of a sort. Molo, the elder brother, stayed at home
    and made himself indispensable. He was the <i lang="sm">tamafafine</i>, the
    child of the distaff side, and it was his rôle to take his position
    for granted, the <i lang="sm">tamafafine</i> of the house of Fua, what more
    could any one ask in the way of immediate prestige. As for the
    future—his manner was perfect. All of these young men, and likewise
    Alo, the great nephew, were members of the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, grown up and
    ready to assume adult responsibilities. Sisi, the sixteen-year-old
    legitimate son, was still a boy, slender, diffident, presuming far
    less upon his position as son and heir-apparent than did his cousin.
    He was an attractive, intelligent boy. If his father lived until Sisi
    was twenty-five or thirty, his succession seemed inevitable. Even
    should his father die sooner, the title might have been held for him.
    But in this latter possibility there was one danger. Samala, his
    father’s older brother, would <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>have a strong voice in the choice of
    a successor to the title. And Alo was Samala’s adored grandson, the
    son of his favourite daughter. Alo was the model of all that a young
    man should be. He eschewed the company of women, stayed much at home
    and rigorously trained his younger brother and sister. While the
    other young men played cricket, he sat at Samala’s feet and memorised
    genealogies. He never forgot that he was the son of Sāfuá, the house
    of Fua. More able than Molo, his claim to the title was practically
    as good, although within the family group Molo as the child of the
    distaff side would always outvote him. So Alo was Sisi’s most dangerous
    rival, provided his father died soon. And should Fua live twenty years
    longer, another complication threatened his succession. Fua had but
    recently remarried, a woman of very high rank and great wealth who
    had a five-year-old illegitimate son, Nifo. Thinking always of this
    child, for she and Fua had no children, she did all that she could to
    undermine Sisi’s position as heir-apparent and there was every chance
    that as her ascendency over Fua increased with his advancing age, she
    might have Nifo named as his successor. His illegitimacy and lack of
    blood tie would be offset by the fact that he was child of the distaff
    side in the noblest family in the island and would inherit great wealth
    from his mother.</p>

  <p>Of a different character was the problem which confronted Sila, the
    stepdaughter of Ono, a <i lang="sm">matai</i> of low rank. She was the eldest
    in a family of seven children. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>Ono was an old man, decrepit and
    ineffective. Lefu, Sila’s mother and his second wife, was worn out,
    weary from bearing eleven children. The only adult males in the
    household were Laisa, Ono’s brother, an old man like himself, and
    Laisa’s idle shiftless son, a man of thirty, whose only interest in
    life was love affairs. He was unmarried and shied away from this
    responsibility as from all others. The sister next younger than Sila
    was sixteen. She had left home and lived, now here, now there, among
    her relatives. Sila was twenty-two. She had been married at sixteen
    and against her will to a man much older than herself who had beaten
    her for her childish ways. After two years of married life, she had
    run away from her husband and gone home to live with her parents,
    bringing her little two-year-old boy, who was now five years old,
    with her. At twenty she had had a love affair with a boy of her own
    village, and borne a daughter who had lived only a few months. After
    her baby died her lover had deserted her. Sila disliked matrimony. She
    was conscientious, sharp-tongued, industrious. She worked tirelessly
    for her child and her small brothers and sisters. She did not want to
    marry again. But there were three old people and six children in her
    household with only herself and her idle cousin to provide for them.
    And so she said despondently: “I think I will get married to that boy.”
    “Which boy, Sila?” I asked. “The father of my baby who is dead.” “But
    I thought you said you did not want him for a husband?” “No more do I.
    But I <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>must find some one to care for my family.” And indeed there was
    no other way. Her stepfather’s title was a very low one. There were no
    young men within the family to succeed to it. Her lover was industrious
    and of even lower degree. The bait of the title would secure a worker
    for the family.</p>

  <p>And so within many households the shadow of nobility falls upon the
    children, sometimes lightly, sometimes heavily, often long before they
    are old enough to understand the meaning of these intrusions from the
    adult world.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE GIRL AND HER AGE GROUP</div>

  <p>Until a child is six or seven at least she associates very little with
    her contemporaries. Brothers and sisters and small cousins who live in
    the same household, of course, frolic and play together, but outside
    the household each child clings closely to its older guardian and only
    comes in contact with other children in case the little nursemaids
    are friends. But at about seven years of age, the children begin to
    form larger groups, a kind of voluntary association which never exists
    in later life, that is, a group recruited from both relationship and
    neighbourhood groups. These are strictly divided along sex lines and
    antagonism between the small girls and the small boys is one of the
    salient features of the group life. The little girls are just beginning
    to “be ashamed” in the presence of older brothers, and the prohibition
    that one small girl must never join a group of boys is beginning to be
    enforced. The fact that the boys are less burdened and so can range
    further afield in search of adventure, while the girls have to carry
    their heavy little charges with them, also makes a difference between
    the sexes. The groups of small children which hang about the fringes of
    some adult <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>activity often contain both girls and boys, but here the
    association principle is simply age discrimination on the part of their
    elders, rather than voluntary association on the children’s part.</p>

  <p>These age gangs are usually confined to the children who live in
    eight or ten contiguous households.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They are flexible chance
    associations, the members of which manifest a vivid hostility towards
    their contemporaries in neighbouring villages and sometimes towards
    other gangs within their own village. Blood ties cut across these
    neighbourhood alignments so that a child may be on good terms with
    members of two or three different groups. A strange child from another
    group, provided she came alone, could usually take refuge beside a
    relative. But the little girls of Siufaga looked askance at the little
    girls of Lumā, the nearest village and both looked with even greater
    suspicion at the little girls from Faleasao, who lived twenty minutes’
    walk away. However, heart burnings over these divisions were very
    temporary affairs. When Tua’s brother was ill, her entire family moved
    from the far end of Siufaga into the heart of Lumā. For a few days Tua
    hung rather dolefully about the house, only to be taken in within a
    week by the central Lumā children with complete amiability. But when
    she returned some weeks later to Siufaga, she became again “a Siufaga
    girl,” object elect of institutionalised scorn and gibes to her recent
    companions.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

  <p>No very intense friendships are made at this age. The relationship and
    neighbourhood structure of the group overshadows the personalities
    within it. Also the most intense affection is always reserved for near
    relatives and pairs of little sisters take the place of chums. The
    Western comment, “Yes, Mary and Julia are such good friends as well as
    sisters!” becomes in Samoa, “But she is a relative,” if a friendship is
    commented upon. The older ones fend for the younger, give them their
    spoils, weave them flower necklaces and give them their most treasured
    shells. This relationship aspect is the only permanent element in the
    group and even this is threatened by any change of residence. The
    emotional tone attached to the inhabitants of a strange village tends
    to make even a well-known cousin seem a little strange.</p>

  <p>Of the different groups of little girls there was only one which
    showed characteristics which would make it possible to classify it as
    a gang. An accident of residence accounts for the most intense group
    development being in the centre of Lumā, where nine little girls of
    nearly the same age and with abundant relationship ties lived close
    together. The development of a group which played continually together
    and maintained a fairly coherent hostility towards outsiders, seems to
    be more of a function of residence than of the personality of any child
    particularly endowed with powers of leadership. The nine little girls
    in this group were less shy, less suspicious, more generous towards one
    another, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>more socially enterprising than other children of the same
    age and in general reflected the socialising effects of group life.
    Outside this group, the children of this age had to rely much more upon
    their immediate relationship group reinforced perhaps by the addition
    of one or two neighbours. Where the personality of a child stood out
    it was more because of exceptional home environment than a result of
    social give-and-take with children of her own age.</p>

  <p>Children of this age had no group activities except play, in direct
    antithesis to the home life where the child’s only function was
    work—baby-tending and the performance of numerous trivial tasks and
    innumerable errands. They foregathered in the early evening, before
    the late Samoan supper, and occasionally during the general siesta
    hour in the afternoon. On moonlight nights they scoured the villages
    alternately attacking or fleeing from the gangs of small boys, peeking
    through drawn shutters, catching land crabs, ambushing wandering
    lovers, or sneaking up to watch a birth or a miscarriage in some
    distant house. Possessed by a fear of the chiefs, a fear of small boys,
    a fear of their relatives and by a fear of ghosts, no gang of less than
    four or five dared to venture forth on these nocturnal excursions. They
    were veritable groups of little outlaws escaping from the exactions
    of routine tasks. Because of the strong feeling for relationship and
    locality, the part played by stolen time, the need for immediately
    executed group plans, and the punishment <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>which hung over the heads
    of children who got too far out of earshot, the Samoan child was as
    dependent upon the populousness of her immediate locality, as is the
    child in a rural community in the West. True her isolation here was
    never one-eighth of a mile in extent, but glaring sun and burning
    sands, coupled with the number of relatives to be escaped from in the
    day or the number of ghosts to be escaped from at night, magnified
    this distance until as a barrier to companionship it was equivalent
    to three or four miles in rural America. Thus there occurred the
    phenomenon of the isolated child in a village full of children of her
    own age. Such was Luna, aged ten, who lived in one of the scattered
    houses belonging to a high chief’s household. This house was situated
    at the very end of the village where she lived with her grandmother,
    her mother’s sister Sami, Sami’s husband and baby, and two younger
    maternal aunts, aged seventeen and fifteen. Luna’s mother was dead. Her
    other brothers and sisters lived on another island with her father’s
    people. She was ten, but young for her age, a quiet, listless child,
    reluctant to take the initiative, the sort of child who would always
    need an institutionalised group life. Her only relatives close by were
    two girls of fourteen, whose long legs and absorption in semi-adult
    tasks made them far too grown-up companions for her. Some little girls
    of fourteen might have tolerated Luna about, but not Selu, the younger
    of the cousins, whose fine mat was already three feet under way. In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>the next house, a stone’s throw away, lived two little girls, Pimi and
    Vana, aged eight and ten. But they were not relatives and being chief
    baby-tenders to four younger children, they had no time for exploring.
    There were no common relatives to bring them together and so Luna lived
    a solitary life, except when an enterprising young aunt of eleven
    came home to her mother’s house. This aunt, Siva, was a fascinating
    companion, a vivid and precocious child, whom Luna followed about in
    open-mouthed astonishment. But Siva had proved too much of a handful
    for her widowed mother, and the <i lang="sm">matai</i>, her uncle, had taken her
    to live in his immediate household at the other end of the village,
    on the other side of the central Lumā gang. They formed far more
    attractive companions and Siva seldom got as far as her mother’s house
    in her occasional moments of freedom. So unenterprising Luna cared for
    her little cousin, followed her aunt and grandmother about and most of
    the time presented a very forlorn appearance.</p>

  <p>In strong contrast was the fate of Lusi, who was only seven, too young
    to be really eligible for the games of her ten- and eleven-year-old
    elders. Had she lived in an isolated spot, she would have been merely
    a neighbourhood baby. But her house was in a strategic position, next
    door to that of her cousins, Maliu and Pola, important members of
    the Lumā gang. Maliu, one of the oldest members of the group, had a
    tremendous feeling for all her young relatives, and Lusi was her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>first
    cousin. So tiny, immature Lusi had the full benefit of a group life
    denied to Luna.</p>

  <p>At the extreme end of Siufaga lived Vina, a gentle, unassuming girl of
    fourteen. Her father’s house stood all alone in the centre of a grove
    of palm trees, just out of sight and ear-shot of the nearest neighbour.
    Her only companions were her first cousin, a reserved capable
    eighteen-year-old and two cousins of seventeen and nineteen. There was
    one little cousin of twelve also in the neighbourhood, but five younger
    brothers and sisters kept her busy. Vina also had several brothers and
    sisters younger than herself, but they were old enough to fend for
    themselves and Vina was comparatively free to follow the older girls
    on fishing expeditions. So she never escaped from being the little
    girl, tagging after older ones, carrying their loads and running their
    errands. She was a flurried anxious child, overconcerned with pleasing
    others, docile in her chance encounters with contemporaries from long
    habit of docility. A free give-and-take relationship within her own age
    group had been denied to her and was now denied to her forever. For it
    was only to the eight- to twelve-year-old girl that this casual group
    association was possible. As puberty approached, and a girl gained
    physical strength and added skill, her household absorbed her again.
    She must make the oven, she must go to work on the plantation, she must
    fish. Her days were filled with long tasks and new responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Such a child was Fitu. In September she was one <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>of the dominant
    members of the gang, a little taller than the rest, a little lankier,
    more strident and executive, but very much a harum-scarum little girl
    among little girls, with a great baby always on her hip. But by April
    she had turned the baby over to a younger sister of nine; the still
    younger baby was entrusted to a little sister of five and Fitu worked
    with her mother on the plantations, or went on long expeditions after
    hibiscus bark, or for fish. She took the family washing to the sea and
    helped make the oven on cooking days. Occasionally in the evening she
    slipped away to play games on the green with her former companions but
    usually she was too tired from the heavy unaccustomed work, and also
    a slight strangeness had crept over her. She felt that her more adult
    activities set her off from the rest of the group with whom she had
    felt so much at home the fall before. She made only abortive attempts
    to associate with the older girls in the neighbourhood. Her mother sent
    her to sleep in the pastor’s house next door, but she returned home
    after three days. Those girls were all too old, she said. “Laititi
    a’u” (“I am but young”). And yet she was spoiled for her old group.
    The three villages numbered fourteen such children, just approaching
    puberty, preoccupied by unaccustomed tasks and renewed and closer
    association with the adults of their families, not yet interested in
    boys, and so forming no new alliances in accordance with sex interests.
    Soberly they perform their household tasks, select a teacher from
    the older <span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>women of their family, learn to bear the suffix, meaning
    “little” dropped from the “little girl” which had formerly described
    them. But they never again amalgamate into such free and easy groups as
    the before-the-teens gang. As sixteen- and seventeen-year-old girls,
    they will still rely upon relatives, and the picture is groupings of
    twos or of threes, never more. The neighbourhood feelings drop out and
    girls of seventeen will ignore a near neighbour who is an age mate
    and go the length of the village to visit a relative. Relationship
    and similar sex interests are now the deciding factor in friendships.
    Girls also followed passively the stronger allegiance of the boys. If a
    girl’s sweetheart has a chum who is interested in a cousin of hers, the
    girls strike up a lively, but temporary, friendship. Occasionally such
    friendships even go outside of the relationship group.</p>

  <p>Although girls may confide only in one or two girl relatives, their
    sex status is usually sensed by the other women of the village and
    alliances shift and change on this basis, from the shy adolescent
    who is suspicious of all older girls, to the girl whose first or
    second love affair still looms as very important, to the girls who
    are beginning to centre all their attention upon one boy and possibly
    matrimony. Finally the unmarried mother selects her friends, when
    possible, from those in like case with herself, or from women of
    ambiguous marital position, deserted or discredited young wives.</p>

  <p>Very few friendships of younger for older girls cut <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>across these
    groupings after puberty. The twelve-year-old may have a great affection
    and admiration for her sixteen-year-old cousin (although any of these
    enthusiasms for older girls are pallid matters compared to a typical
    school girl “crush” in our civilisation). But when she is fifteen
    and her cousin nineteen, the picture changes. All of the adult and
    near-adult world is hostile, spying upon her love affairs in its more
    circumspect sophistication, supremely not to be trusted. No one is
    to be trusted who is not immediately engaged in similarly hazardous
    adventures.</p>

  <p>It may safely be said that without the artificial conditions
    produced by residence in the native pastor’s household or in the
    large missionary boarding school, the girls do not go outside their
    relationship group to make friends. (In addition to the large girls’
    boarding school which served all of American Samoa, the native pastor
    of each community maintained a small informal boarding school for
    boys and girls. To these schools were sent the girls whose fathers
    wished to send them later to the large boarding school, and also girls
    whose parents wished them to have three or four years of the superior
    educational advantages and stricter supervision of the pastor’s home.)
    Here unrelated girls live side by side sometimes for years. But as
    one of the two defining features of a household is common residence,
    the friendships formed between girls who have lived in the pastor’s
    household are not very different psychologically from the friendship
    of cousins or girls <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>connected only by affinity who live in the same
    family. The only friendships which really are different in kind from
    those formed by common residence or membership in the same relationship
    group, are the institutionalised relationships between the wives of
    chiefs and the wives of talking chiefs. But these friendships can only
    be understood in connection with the friendships among boys and men.</p>

  <p>The little boys follow the same pattern as do the little girls,
    running in a gang based upon the double bonds of neighbourhood and
    relationship. The feeling for the ascendency of age is always much
    stronger than in the case of girls because the older boys do not
    withdraw into their family groups as do the girls. The fifteen- and
    sixteen-year-old boys gang together with the same freedom as do the
    twelve-year-olds. The borderline between small boys and bigger boys
    is therefore a continually shifting one, the boys in an intermediate
    position now lording it over the younger boys, now tagging obsequiously
    in the wake of their elders. There are two institutionalised
    relationships between boys which are called by the same name and
    possibly were at one time one relationship. This is the <i lang="sm">soa</i>, the
    companion at circumcision and the ambassador in love affairs. Boys are
    circumcised in pairs, making the arrangements themselves and seeking
    out an older man who has acquired a reputation for skilfulness. There
    seems to be here simply a logical inter-relationship of cause and
    effect; a boy chooses a friend (who is usually <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>also a relative) as his
    companion and the experience shared binds them closer together. There
    were several pairs of boys in the village who had been circumcised
    together and were still inseparable companions, often sleeping together
    in the house of one of them. Casual homosexual practices occurred in
    such relationships. However, when the friendships of grown boys of the
    village were analysed, no close correspondence with the adolescent
    allegiance was found and older boys were as often found in groups of
    three or four as in pairs.</p>

  <p>When a boy is two or three years past puberty, his choice of a
    companion is influenced by the convention that a young man seldom
    speaks for himself in love and never in a proposal of marriage. He
    accordingly needs a friend of about his age whom he can trust to sing
    his praises and press his suit with requisite fervour and discretion.
    For this office, a relative, or, if the affair be desperate, several
    relatives are employed. A youth is influenced in his choice by his need
    of an ambassador who is not only trustworthy and devoted but plausible
    and insinuating as a procurer. This <i lang="sm">soa</i> relationship is often,
    but not necessarily, reciprocal. The expert in love comes in time to
    dispense with the services of an intermediary, wishing to taste to
    the full the sweets of all the stages in courtship. At the same time
    his services are much in demand by others, if they entertain any hope
    at all of his dealing honourably by his principal. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>But the boys have
    also other matters besides love-making in which they must co-operate.
    Three are needed to man a bonito canoe; two usually go together to
    lasso eels on the reef; work on the communal taro plantations demands
    the labour of all the youths in the village. So that while a boy
    too chooses his best friends from among his relatives, his sense of
    social solidarity is always much stronger than that of a girl. The
    <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>, the organisation of young girls and wives of untitled
    men, is an exceedingly loose association gathered for very occasional
    communal work, and still more occasional festivities. In villages where
    the old intricacies of the social organisation are beginning to fall
    into disuse, it is the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> which disappears first, while the
    <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, the young men’s organisation, has too important a place
    in the village economy to be thus ignored. The <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> is indeed
    the most enduring social factor in the village. The <i lang="sm">matais</i> meet
    more formally and spend a great deal of time in their own households,
    but the young men work together during the day, feast before and after
    their labours, are present as a serving group at all meetings of the
    <i lang="sm">matais</i>, and when the day’s work is over, dance and go courting
    together in the evening. Many of the young men sleep in their friends’
    houses, a privilege but grudgingly accorded the more chaperoned girls.</p>

  <p>Another factor which qualified men’s relationships is the reciprocal
    relationship between chiefs and talking chiefs. The holders of these
    two classes of titles are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>not necessarily related, although this is
    often the case as it is considered an advantage to be related to both
    ranks. But the talking chiefs are major domos, assistants, ambassadors,
    henchmen, and councillors of their chiefs, and these relationships are
    often foreshadowed among the young men, the heirs-apparent or the heirs
    aspirant to the family titles.</p>

  <p>Among women there are occasional close alliances between the
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and the daughter of her father’s principal talking chief.
    But these friendships always suffer from their temporary character;
    the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> will inevitably marry into another village. And it is
    rather between the wife of the chief and the wife of a talking chief
    that the institutionalised and life-long friendship exists. The wife of
    the talking chief acts as assistant, advisor, and mouthpiece for the
    chief’s wife and in turn counts upon the chief’s wife for support and
    material help. It is a friendship based upon reciprocal obligations
    having their origins in the relationship between the women’s husbands,
    and it is the only women’s friendship which oversteps the limits of
    the relationship and affinity group. Such friendships based on an
    accident of marriage and enjoined by the social structure should hardly
    be classed as voluntary. And within the relationship group itself,
    friendship is so patterned as to be meaningless. I once asked a young
    married woman if a neighbour with whom she was always upon the most
    uncertain and irritated terms was a friend of hers. “Why, of course,
    her mother’s father’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>father, and my father’s mother’s father were
    brothers.” Friendship based on temperamental congeniality was a most
    tenuous bond, subject to shifts of interest and to shifts of residence,
    and a woman came to rely more and more on the associates to whose
    society and interest blood and marriage entitled her.</p>

  <p>Association based upon age as a principle may be said to have ceased
    for the girls before puberty, due to the exceedingly individual nature
    of their tasks and the need for secrecy in their amatory adventures.
    In the case of the boys, greater freedom, a more compelling social
    structure, and continuous participation in co-operative tasks, brings
    about an age-group association which lasts through life. This grouping
    is influenced but not determined by relationship, and distorted by the
    influence of rank, prospective rank in the case of youth, equal rank
    but disproportionate age in the case of older men.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE GIRL IN THE COMMUNITY</div>

  <p>The community ignores both boys and girls from birth until they are
    fifteen or sixteen years of age. Children under this age have no social
    standing, no recognised group activities, no part in the social life
    except when they are conscripted for the informal dance floor. But at
    a year or two beyond puberty—the age varies from village to village so
    that boys of sixteen will in one place still be classed as small boys,
    in another as <i lang="sm">taule’ale’as</i>, young men—both boys and girls are
    grouped into a rough approximation of the adult groupings, given a name
    for their organisation, and are invested with definite obligations and
    privileges in the community life.</p>

  <p>The organisation of young men, the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, of young girls and
    the wives of untitled men and widows, the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>, and of the
    wives of titled men, are all echoes of the central political structure
    of the village, the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>, the organisation of <i lang="sm">matais</i>, men
    who have the titles of chiefs or of talking chiefs. The <i lang="sm">Fono</i> is
    always conceived as a round house in which each title has a special
    position, must be addressed with certain ceremonial phrases, and given
    a fixed place in the order of precedence in the serving of the kava.
    This ideal house has certain fixed divisions, in the right sector sit
    the high chief and his special assistant chiefs; in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>front of the
    house sit the talking chiefs whose business it is to make the speeches,
    welcome strangers, accept gifts, preside over the distribution of food
    and make all plans and arrangements for group activities. Against
    the posts at the back of the house sit the <i lang="sm">matais</i> of low
    rank, and between the posts and at the centre sit those of so little
    importance that no place is reserved for them. This framework of titles
    continues from generation to generation and holds a fixed place in the
    larger ideal structure of the titles of the whole island, the whole
    archipelago, the whole of Samoa. With some of these titles, which
    are in the gift of certain families, go certain privileges, a right
    to a house name, a right to confer a <i lang="sm">taupo</i> name, a princess
    title, upon some young girl relative and an heir-apparent title, the
    <i lang="sm">manaia</i>, on some boy of the household. Besides these prerogatives
    of the high chiefs, each member of the two classes of <i lang="sm">matais</i>,
    chiefs and talking chiefs, has certain ceremonial rights. A talking
    chief must be served his kava with a special gesture, must be addressed
    with a separate set of verbs and nouns suitable to his rank, must
    be rewarded by the chiefs in tapa or fine mats for his ceremonially
    rendered services. The chiefs must be addressed with still another set
    of nouns and verbs, must be served with a different and more honourable
    gesture in the kava ceremony, must be furnished with food by their
    talking chiefs, must be honoured and escorted by the talking chiefs on
    every important occasion. The name of the village, the ceremonial name
    of the public square in which great ceremonies <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>are held, the name of
    the meeting house of the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>, the names of the principal chiefs
    and talking chiefs, the names of <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and <i lang="sm">manaia</i>, of
    the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> and the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, are contained in a set of
    ceremonial salutations called the <i lang="sm">Fa’alupega</i>, or courtesy titles
    of a village or district. Visitors on formally entering a village must
    recite the <i lang="sm">Fa’alupega</i> as their initial courtesy to their hosts.</p>

  <p>The <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> mirrors this organisation of the older men. Here the
    young men learn to make speeches, to conduct themselves with gravity
    and decorum, to serve and drink the kava, to plan and execute group
    enterprises. When a boy is old enough to enter the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, the
    head of his household either sends a present of food to the group,
    announcing the addition of the boy to their number, or takes him to
    a house where they are meeting and lays down a great kava root as a
    present. Henceforth the boy is a member of a group which is almost
    constantly together. Upon them falls all the heavy work of the village
    and also the greater part of the social intercourse between villages
    which centres about the young unmarried people. When a visiting village
    comes, it is the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> which calls in a body upon the visiting
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, taking gifts, dancing and singing for her benefit.</p>

  <p>The organisation of the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> is a less formalised version
    of the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>. When a girl is of age, two or three years past
    puberty, varying with the village practice, her <i lang="sm">matai</i> will send
    an offering of food to the house of the chief <i lang="sm">taupo</i> of the
    village, thus announcing <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>that he wishes the daughter of his house to
    be henceforth counted as one of the group of young girls who form her
    court. But while the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> is centred about the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>,
    the young men meeting outside or in a separate house, but exactly
    mirroring the forms and ceremonies of their elders, the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>
    is centred about the person of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, forming a group of
    maids of honour. They have no organisation as have the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>,
    and furthermore, they do hardly any work. Occasionally the young
    girls may be called upon to sew thatch or gather paper mulberry; more
    occasionally they plant and cultivate a paper mulberry crop, but their
    main function is to be ceremonial helpers for the meetings of the wives
    of <i lang="sm">matais</i>, and village hostesses in inter-village life. In many
    parts of Samoa the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> has fallen entirely to pieces and
    is only remembered in the greeting words that fall from the lips of a
    stranger. But if the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> should disappear, Samoan village
    life would have to be entirely reorganised, for upon the ceremonial and
    actual work of the young and untitled men the whole life of the village
    depends.</p>

  <p>Although the wives of <i lang="sm">matais</i> have no organisation recognised in
    the <i lang="sm">Fa’alupega</i> (courtesy titles), their association is firmer
    and more important than that of the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>. The wives of titled
    men hold their own formal meetings, taking their status from their
    husbands, sitting at their husbands’ posts and drinking their husbands’
    kava. The wife of the highest chief receives highest honour, the wife
    of the principal talking <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>chief makes the most important speeches. The
    women are completely dependent upon their husbands for their status in
    this village group. Once a man has been given a title, he can never go
    back to the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>. His title may be taken away from him when
    he is old, or if he is inefficient, but a lower title will be given
    him that he may sit and drink his kava with his former associates. But
    the widow or divorced wife of a <i lang="sm">matai</i> must go back into the
    <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>, sit with the young girls outside the house, serve the
    food and run the errands, entering the women’s <i lang="sm">fono</i> only as a
    servant or an entertainer.</p>

  <p>The women’s <i lang="sm">fonos</i> are of two sorts: <i lang="sm">fonos</i> which precede
    or follow communal work, sewing the thatch for a guest house, bringing
    the coral rubble for its floor or weaving fine mats for the dowry of
    the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>; and ceremonial <i lang="sm">fonos</i> to welcome visitors
    from another village. Each of these meetings was designated by its
    purpose, as a <i lang="sm">falelalaga</i>, a weaving bee, or an <i lang="sm">’aiga
    fiafia tama’ita’i</i>, ladies’ feast. The women are only recognised
    socially by the women of a visiting village but the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and
    her court are the centre of the recognition of both men and women
    in the <i lang="sm">malaga</i>, the traveling party. And these wives of high
    chiefs have to treat their own <i lang="sm">taupo</i> with great courtesy and
    respect, address her as “your highness,” accompany her on journeys,
    use a separate set of nouns and verbs when speaking to her. Here then
    is a discrepancy in which the young girls who are kept in strict
    subjection within their households, outrank their aunts and mothers
    in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>the social life between villages. This ceremonial undercutting of
    the older women’s authority might seriously jeopardise the discipline
    of the household, if it were not for two considerations. The first
    is the tenuousness of the girls’ organisation, the fact that within
    the village their chief <i lang="fr">raison d’être</i> is to dance attendance
    upon the older women, who have definite industrial tasks to perform
    for the village; the second is the emphasis upon the idea of service
    as the chief duty of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. The village princess is also
    the village servant. It is she who waits upon strangers, spreads
    their beds and makes their kava, dances when they wish it, and rises
    from her sleep to serve either the visitors or her own chief. And she
    is compelled to serve the social needs of the women as well as the
    men. Do they decide to borrow thatch in another village, they dress
    their <i lang="sm">taupo</i> in her best and take her along to decorate the
    <i lang="sm">malaga</i>. Her marriage is a village matter, planned and carried
    through by the talking chiefs and their wives who are her counsellors
    and chaperons. So that the rank of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> is really a further
    daily inroad upon her freedom as an individual, while the incessant
    chaperonage to which she is subjected and the way in which she is
    married without regard to her own wishes are a complete denial of her
    personality. And similarly, the slighter prestige of her untitled
    sisters, whose chief group activity is waiting upon their elders, has
    even less real significance in the daily life of the village.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, the assumption of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>whose title
    is the occasion of a great festival and enormous distribution of
    property by her chief to the talking chiefs who must hereafter support
    and confirm her rank, a Samoan girl of good family has two ways of
    making her début. The first, the formal entry into the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>
    is often neglected and is more a formal fee to the community than
    a recognition of the girl herself. The second way is to go upon a
    <i lang="sm">malaga</i>, a formal travelling party. She may go as a near relative
    of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> in which case she will be caught up in a whirl of
    entertainment with which the young men of the host village surround
    their guests; or she may travel as the only girl in a small travelling
    party in which case she will be treated as a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. (All social
    occasions demand the presence of a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, a <i lang="sm">manaia</i>, and
    a talking chief; and if individuals actually holding these titles
    are not present, some one else has to play the rôle.) Thus it is in
    inter-village life, either as a member of the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> who call
    upon and dance for the <i lang="sm">manaia</i> of the visiting <i lang="sm">malaga</i>, or
    as a visiting girl in a strange village, that the unmarried Samoan girl
    is honoured and recognised by her community.</p>

  <p>But these are exceptional occasions. A <i lang="sm">malaga</i> may come only once
    a year, especially in Manu’a which numbers only seven villages in the
    whole archipelago. And in the daily life of the village, at crises,
    births, deaths, marriages, the unmarried girls have no ceremonial part
    to play. They are simply included with the “women of the household”
    whose duty it is to prepare the layette for the new baby, or carry
    stones to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>strew on the new grave. It is almost as if the community
    by its excessive recognition of the girl as a <i lang="sm">taupo</i> or member of
    the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>, considered itself exonerated from paying any more
    attention to her.</p>

    <img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" id="i_080">
    <figcaption><i>The local parliament is convened</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This attitude is fostered by the scarcity of taboos. In many parts of
    Polynesia, all women, and especially menstruating women, are considered
    contaminating and dangerous. A continuous rigorous social supervision
    is necessary, for a society can no more afford to ignore its most
    dangerous members than it can afford to neglect its most valuable.
    But in Samoa a girl’s power of doing harm is very limited. She cannot
    make <i lang="sm">tafolo</i>, a breadfruit pudding usually made by the young
    men in any case, nor make the kava while she is menstruating. But she
    need retire to no special house; she need not eat alone; there is no
    contamination in her touch or look. In common with the young men and
    the older women, a girl gives a wide berth to a place where chiefs are
    engaged in formal work, unless she has special business there. It is
    not the presence of a woman which is interdicted but the uncalled-for
    intrusion of any one of either sex. No woman can be officially present
    at a gathering of chiefs unless she is <i lang="sm">taupo</i> making the kava,
    but any woman may bring her husband his pipe or come to deliver a
    message, so long as her presence need not be recognised. The only place
    where a woman’s femininity is in itself a real source of danger is in
    the matter of fishing canoes and fishing tackle which she is forbidden
    to touch upon pain of spoiling the fishing. But the enforcement of this
    prohibition is in the hands of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>individual fishermen in whose houses
    the fishing equipment is kept.</p>

  <p>Within the relationship group matters are entirely different. Here
    women are very specifically recognised. The oldest female progenitor
    of the line, that is, the sister of the last holder of the title, or
    his predecessor’s sister, has special rights over the distribution of
    the dowry which comes into the household. She holds the veto in the
    selling of land and other important family matters. Her curse is the
    most dreadful a man can incur for she has the power to “cut the line”
    and make the name extinct. If a man falls ill, it is his sister who
    must first take the formal oath that she has wished him no harm, as
    anger in her heart is most potent for evil. When a man dies, it is his
    paternal aunt or his sister who prepares the body for burial, anointing
    it with turmeric and rubbing it with oil, and it is she who sits beside
    the body, fanning away the flies, and keeps the fan in her possession
    ever after. And, in the more ordinary affairs of the household, in the
    economic arrangements between relatives, in disputes over property or
    in family feuds, the women play as active a part as the men.</p>

  <p>The girl and woman repays the general social negligence which she
    receives with a corresponding insouciance. She treats the lore
    of the village, the genealogies of the titles, the origin myths
    and local tales, the intricacies of the social organisation with
    supreme indifference. It is an exceptional girl who can give her
    great-grandfather’s name, the exceptional boy who cannot <span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>give his
    genealogy in traditional form for several generations. While the boy
    of sixteen or seventeen is eagerly trying to master the esoteric
    allusiveness of the talking chief whose style he most admires, the girl
    of the same age learns the minimum of etiquette. Yet this is in no
    wise due to lack of ability. The <i lang="sm">taupo</i> must have a meticulous
    knowledge, not only of the social arrangements of her own village,
    but also of those of neighbouring villages. She must serve visitors
    in proper form and with no hesitation after the talking chief has
    chanted their titles and the names of their kava cups. Should she take
    the wrong post which is the prerogative of another <i lang="sm">taupo</i> who
    outranks her, her hair will be soundly pulled by her rival’s female
    attendants. She learns the intricacies of the social organisation as
    well as her brother does. Still more notable is the case of the wife
    of a talking chief. Whether she is chosen for her docility by a man
    who has already assumed his title, or whether, as is often the case,
    she marries some boy of her acquaintance who later is made a talking
    chief, the <i lang="sm">tausi</i>, wife of a talking chief, is quite equal to the
    occasion. In the meetings of women she must be a master of etiquette
    and the native rules of order, she must interlard her speeches with a
    wealth of unintelligible traditional material and rich allusiveness,
    she must preserve the same even voice, the same lofty demeanour, as
    her husband. And ultimately, the wife of an important talking chief
    must qualify as a teacher as well as a performer, for it is her duty to
    train the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. But unless the community thus recognises her
    existence, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>and makes formal demand upon her time and ability, a woman
    gives to it a bare minimum of her attention.</p>

  <p>In like manner, women are not dealt with in the primitive penal code. A
    man who commits adultery with a chief’s wife was beaten and banished,
    sometimes even drowned by the outraged community, but the woman was
    only cast out by her husband. The <i lang="sm">taupo</i> who was found not to
    be a virgin was simply beaten by her female relatives. To-day if evil
    befalls the village, and it is attributed to some unconfessed sin
    on the part of a member of the community, the <i lang="sm">Fono</i> and the
    <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> are convened and confession is enjoined upon any one who
    may have evil upon his conscience, but no such demand is made upon the
    <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> or the wives of the <i lang="sm">matais</i>. This is in striking
    contrast to the family confessional where the sister is called upon
    first.</p>

  <p>In matters of work the village makes a few precise demands. It is the
    women’s work to cultivate the sugar cane and sew the thatch for the
    roof of the guest house, to weave the palm leaf blinds, and bring
    the coral rubble for the floor. When the girls have a paper mulberry
    plantation, the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> occasionally help them in the work,
    the girls in turn making a feast for the boys, turning the whole
    affair into an industrious picnic. But between men’s formal work and
    women’s formal work there is a rigid division. Women do not enter into
    house-building or boat-building activities, nor go out in fishing
    canoes, nor may men enter the formal weaving house or the house where
    women are making tapa in a group. If the women’s work <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>makes it
    necessary for them to cross the village, as is the case when rubble is
    brought up from the seashore to make the floor of the guest house, the
    men entirely disappear, either gathering in some remote house, or going
    away to the bush or to another village. But this avoidance is only for
    large formal occasions. If her husband is building the family a new
    cook-house, a woman may make tapa two feet away, while a chief may sit
    and placidly braid cinet while his wife weaves a fine mat at his elbow.</p>

  <p>So, although unlike her husband and brothers a woman spends most of her
    time within the narrower circle of her household and her relationship
    group, when she does participate in community affairs she is treated
    with the punctilio which marks all phases of Samoan social life. The
    better part of her attention and interest is focused on a smaller
    group, cast in a more personal mode. For this reason, it is impossible
    to evaluate accurately the difference in innate social drive between
    men and women in Samoa. In those social spheres where women have been
    given an opportunity, they take their place with as much ability as
    the men. The wives of the talking chiefs in fact exhibit even greater
    adaptability than their husbands. The talking chiefs are especially
    chosen for their oratorical and intellectual abilities, whereas the
    women have a task thrust upon them at their marriage requiring great
    oratorical skill, a fertile imagination, tact, and a facile memory.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">FORMAL SEX RELATIONS</div>

  <p>The first attitude which a little girl learns towards boys is one of
    avoidance and antagonism. She learns to observe the brother and sister
    taboo towards the boys of her relationship group and household, and
    together with the other small girls of her age group she treats all
    other small boys as enemies elect. After a little girl is eight or nine
    years of age she has learned never to approach a group of older boys.
    This feeling of antagonism towards younger boys and shamed avoidance
    of older ones continues up to the age of thirteen or fourteen, to the
    group of girls who are just reaching puberty and the group of boys who
    have just been circumcised. These children are growing away from the
    age-group life and the age-group antagonisms. They are not yet actively
    sex-conscious. And it is at this time that relationships between the
    sexes are least emotionally charged. Not until she is an old married
    woman with several children will the Samoan girl again regard the
    opposite sex so quietly. When these adolescent children gather together
    there is a good-natured banter, a minimum of embarrassment, a great
    deal of random teasing which usually takes the form of accusing some
    little girl of a consuming passion for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>a decrepit old man of eighty,
    or some small boy of being the father of a buxom matron’s eighth child.
    Occasionally the banter takes the form of attributing affection between
    two age mates and is gaily and indignantly repudiated by both. Children
    at this age meet at informal <i lang="sm">siva</i> parties, on the outskirts of
    more formal occasions, at community reef fishings (when many yards of
    reef have been enclosed to make a great fish trap) and on torch-fishing
    excursions. Good-natured tussling and banter and co-operation in common
    activities are the keynotes of these occasions. But unfortunately
    these contacts are neither frequent nor sufficiently prolonged to
    teach the girls co-operation or to give either boys or girls any real
    appreciation of personality in members of the opposite sex.</p>

  <p>Two or three years later this will all be changed. The fact that little
    girls no longer belong to age groups makes the individual’s defection
    less noticeable. The boy who begins to take an active interest in
    girls is also seen less in a gang and spends more time with one close
    companion. Girls have lost all of their nonchalance. They giggle,
    blush, bridle, run away. Boys become shy, embarrassed, taciturn, and
    avoid the society of girls in the daytime and on the brilliant moonlit
    nights for which they accuse the girls of having an exhibitionistic
    preference. Friendships fall more strictly within the relationship
    group. The boy’s need for a trusted confidante is stronger than that
    of the girl, for only the most adroit and hardened Don Juans do their
    own <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>courting. There are occasions, of course, when two youngsters
    just past adolescence, fearful of ridicule, even from their nearest
    friends and relatives, will slip away alone into the bush. More
    frequently still an older man, a widower or a divorced man, will be
    a girl’s first lover. And here there is no need for an ambassador.
    The older man is neither shy nor frightened, and furthermore there
    is no one whom he can trust as an intermediary; a younger man would
    betray him, an older man would not take his amours seriously. But the
    first spontaneous experiment of adolescent children and the amorous
    excursions of the older men among the young girls of the village are
    variants on the edge of the recognised types of relationships; so also
    is the first experience of a young boy with an older woman. But both
    of these are exceedingly frequent occurrences, so that the success
    of an amatory experience is seldom jeopardised by double ignorance.
    Nevertheless, all of these occasions are outside the recognised forms
    into which sex relations fall. The little boy and girl are branded by
    their companions as guilty of <i lang="sm">tautala lai titi</i> (presuming above
    their ages) as is the boy who loves or aspires to love an older woman,
    while the idea of an older man pursuing a young girl appeals strongly
    to their sense of humour; or if the girl is very young and naïve, to
    their sense of unfitness. “She is too young, too young yet. He is too
    old,” they will say, and the whole weight of vigorous disapproval fell
    upon a <i lang="sm">matai</i> who was known to be <span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>the father of the child of
    Lotu, the sixteen-year-old feeble-minded girl on Olesega. Discrepancy
    in age or experience always strikes them as comic or pathetic according
    to the degree. The theoretical punishment which is meted out to a
    disobedient and runaway daughter is to marry her to a very old man,
    and I have heard a nine-year-old giggle contemptuously over her
    mother’s preference for a seventeen-year-old boy. Worst among these
    unpatterned deviations is that of the man who makes love to some young
    and dependent woman of his household, his adopted child or his wife’s
    younger sister. The cry of incest is raised against him and sometimes
    feeling runs so high that he has to leave the group.</p>

  <p>Besides formal marriage there are only two types of sex relations
    which receive any formal recognition from the community—love affairs
    between unmarried young people (this includes the widowed) who are very
    nearly of the same age, whether leading to marriage or merely a passing
    diversion; and adultery.</p>

  <p>Between the unmarried there are three forms of relationship: the
    clandestine encounter, “under the palm trees,” the published elopement,
    <i lang="sm">Avaga</i>, and the ceremonious courtship in which the boy “sits
    before the girl”; and on the edge of these, the curious form of
    surreptitious rape, called <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, sleep crawling, resorted
    to by youths who find favour in no maiden’s eyes.</p>

  <p>In these three relationships, the boy requires a confidant <span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>and
    ambassador whom he calls a <i lang="sm">soa</i>. Where boys are close companions,
    this relationship may extend over many love affairs, or it may be
    a temporary one, terminating with the particular love affair. The
    <i lang="sm">soa</i> follows the pattern of the talking chief who makes material
    demands upon his chief in return for the immaterial services which he
    renders him. If marriage results from his ambassadorship, he receives a
    specially fine present from the bridegroom. The choice of a <i lang="sm">soa</i>
    presents many difficulties. If the lover chooses a steady, reliable
    boy, some slightly younger relative devoted to his interests, a boy
    unambitious in affairs of the heart, very likely the ambassador will
    bungle the whole affair through inexperience and lack of tact. But if
    he chooses a handsome and expert wooer who knows just how “to speak
    softly and walk gently,” then as likely as not the girl will prefer the
    second to the principal. This difficulty is occasionally anticipated
    by employing two or three <i lang="sm">soas</i> and setting them to spy on each
    other. But such a lack of trust is likely to inspire a similar attitude
    in the agents, and as one overcautious and disappointed lover told me
    ruefully, “I had five <i lang="sm">soas</i>, one was true and four were false.”</p>

  <p>Among possible <i lang="sm">soas</i> there are two preferences, a brother or
    a girl. A brother is by definition loyal, while a girl is far more
    skilful for “a boy can only approach a girl in the evening, or when
    no one is by, but a girl can go with her all day long, walk with her
    and lie on the mat by her, eat off the same platter, and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>whisper
    between mouthfuls the name of the boy, speaking ever of him, how good
    he is, how gentle and how true, how worthy of love. Yes, best of all
    is the <i lang="sm">soafafine</i>, the woman ambassador.” But the difficulties
    of obtaining a <i lang="sm">soafafine</i> are great. A boy may not choose from
    his own female relatives. The taboo forbids him ever to mention such
    matters in their presence. It is only by good chance that his brother’s
    sweetheart may be a relative of the girl upon whom he has set his
    heart; or some other piece of good fortune may throw him into contact
    with a girl or woman who will act in his interests. The most violent
    antagonisms in the young people’s groups are not between ex-lovers,
    arise not from the venom of the deserted nor the smarting pride of the
    jilted, but occur between the boy and the <i lang="sm">soa</i> who has betrayed
    him, or a lover and the friend of his beloved who has in any way
    blocked his suit.</p>

  <p>In the strictly clandestine love affair the lover never presents
    himself at the house of his beloved. His <i lang="sm">soa</i> may go there in a
    group or upon some trumped-up errand, or he also may avoid the house
    and find opportunities to speak to the girl while she is fishing or
    going to and from the plantation. It is his task to sing his friend’s
    praise, counteract the girl’s fears and objections, and finally appoint
    a rendezvous. These affairs are usually of short duration and both boy
    and girl may be carrying on several at once. One of the recognised
    causes of a quarrel is the resentment of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>first lover against his
    successor of the same night, “for the boy who came later will mock
    him.” These clandestine lovers make their rendezvous on the outskirts
    of the village. “Under the palm trees” is the conventionalised
    designation of this type of intrigue. Very often three or four couples
    will have a common rendezvous, when either the boys or the girls are
    relatives who are friends. Should the girl ever grow faint or dizzy,
    it is the boy’s part to climb the nearest palm and fetch down a fresh
    cocoanut to pour on her face in lieu of <i lang="fr">eau de cologne</i>. In
    native theory, barrenness is the punishment of promiscuity; and,
    <i>vice versa</i>, only persistent monogamy is rewarded by conception.
    When a pair of clandestine experimenters whose rank is so low that
    their marriages are not of any great economic importance become
    genuinely attached to each other and maintain the relationship over
    several months, marriage often follows. And native sophistication
    distinguishes between the adept lover whose adventures are many and of
    short duration and the less skilled man who can find no better proof of
    his virility than a long affair ending in conception.</p>

  <p>Often the girl is afraid to venture out into the night, infested with
    ghosts and devils, ghosts that strangle one, ghosts from far-away
    villages who come in canoes to kidnap the girls of the village,
    ghosts who leap upon the back and may not be shaken off. Or she may
    feel that it is wiser to remain at home, and if necessary, attest her
    presence vocally. In this case the lover <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>braves the house; taking
    off his <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>, he greases his body thoroughly with cocoanut
    oil so that he can slip through the fingers of pursuers and leave no
    trace, and stealthily raises the blinds and slips into the house. The
    prevalence of this practice gives point to the familiar incident in
    Polynesian folk tales of the ill fortune that falls the luckless hero
    who “sleeps until morning, until the rising sun reveals his presence
    to the other inmates of the house.” As perhaps a dozen or more people
    and several dogs are sleeping in the house, a due regard for silence
    is sufficient precaution. But it is this habit of domestic rendezvous
    which lends itself to the peculiar abuse of the <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, or
    sleep crawler.</p>

  <p>The <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> is the only sex activity which presents a
    definitely abnormal picture. Ever since the first contact with white
    civilisation, rape, in the form of violent assault, has occurred
    occasionally in Samoa. It is far less congenial, however, to the Samoan
    attitude than <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, in which a man stealthily appropriates
    the favours which are meant for another. The need for guarding against
    discovery makes conversation impossible, and the sleep crawler
    relies upon the girl’s expecting a lover or the chance that she will
    indiscriminately accept any comer. If the girl suspects and resents
    him, she raises a great outcry and the whole household gives chase.
    Catching a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> is counted great sport, and the women,
    who feel their safety endangered, are even more active in pursuit
    than the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>men. One luckless youth in Lumā neglected to remove his
    <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>. The girl discovered him and her sister succeeded in
    biting a piece out of his <i lang="sm">lavalava</i> before he escaped. This she
    proudly exhibited the next day. As the boy had been too dull to destroy
    his <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>, the evidence against him was circumstantial
    and he was the laughing stock of the village; the children wrote
    a dance song about it and sang it after him wherever he went. The
    <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> problem is complicated by the possibility that a boy
    of the household may be the offender and may take refuge in the hue
    and cry following the discovery. It also provides the girl with an
    excellent alibi, since she has only to call out “<i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>” in
    case her lover is discovered. “To the family and the village that may
    be a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, but it is not so in the hearts of the girl and
    the boy.”</p>

  <p>Two motives are given for this unsavoury activity, anger and failure in
    love. The Samoan girl who plays the coquette does so at her peril. “She
    will say, ‘Yes, I will meet you to-night by that old cocoanut tree just
    beside the devilfish stone when the moon goes down.’ And the boy will
    wait and wait and wait all night long. It will grow very dark; lizards
    will drop on his head; the ghost boats will come into the channel. He
    will be very much afraid. But he will wait there until dawn, until his
    hair is wet with dew and his heart is very angry and still she does not
    come. Then in revenge he will attempt a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>. Especially
    will he do so if he hears that she has met another that night.” <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>The
    other set explanation is that a particular boy cannot win a sweetheart
    by any legitimate means, and there is no form of prostitution, except
    guest prostitution in Samoa. As some of the boys who were notorious
    <i lang="sm">moetotolos</i> were among the most charming and good-looking youths
    of the village, this is a little hard to understand. Apparently, these
    youths, frowned upon in one or two tentative courtships, inflamed by
    the loudly proclaimed success of their fellows and the taunts against
    their own inexperience, cast established wooing procedure to the winds
    and attempt a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>. And once caught, once branded, no girl
    will ever pay any attention to them again. They must wait until as
    older men, with position and title to offer, they can choose between
    some weary and bedraggled wanton or the unwilling young daughter of
    ambitious and selfish parents. But years will intervene before this
    is possible, and shut out from the amours in which his companions
    are engaging, a boy makes one attempt after another, sometimes
    successfully, sometimes only to be caught and beaten, mocked by the
    village, and always digging the pit deeper under his feet. Often
    partially satisfactory solutions are relationships with men. There
    was one such pair in the village, a notorious <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, and a
    serious-minded youth who wished to keep his heart free for political
    intrigue. The <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> therefore complicates and adds zest
    to the surreptitious love-making which is conducted at home, while
    the danger of being missed, the undesirability of chance <span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>encounters
    abroad, rain and the fear of ghosts, complicate “love under the palm
    trees.”</p>

  <p>Between these strictly <i>sub rosa</i> affairs and a final offer of
    marriage there is an intermediate form of courtship in which the
    girl is called upon by the boy. As this is regarded as a tentative
    move towards matrimony, both relationship groups must be more or
    less favourably inclined towards the union. With his <i lang="sm">soa</i> at
    his side and provided with a basket of fish, an octopus or so, or a
    chicken, the suitor presents himself at the girl’s home before the late
    evening meal. If his gift is accepted, it is a sign that the family
    of the girl are willing for him to pay his addresses to her. He is
    formally welcomed by the <i lang="sm">matai</i>, sits with reverently bowed head
    throughout the evening prayer, and then he and his <i lang="sm">soa</i> stay for
    supper. But the suitor does not approach his beloved. They say: “If
    you wish to know who is really the lover, look then not at the boy who
    sits by her side, looks boldly into her eyes and twists the flowers
    in her necklace around his fingers or steals the hibiscus flower from
    her hair that he may wear it behind his ear. Do not think it is he who
    whispers softly in her ear, or says to her, ‘Sweetheart, wait for me
    to-night. After the moon has set, I will come to you,’ or who teases
    her by saying she has many lovers. Look instead at the boy who sits
    afar off, who sits with bent head and takes no part in the joking. And
    you will see that his eyes are always turned softly on the girl. Always
    he watches her and never does he miss a movement of her lips. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>Perhaps
    she will wink at him, perhaps she will raise her eyebrows, perhaps she
    will make a sign with her hand. He must always be wakeful and watching
    or he will miss it.” The <i lang="sm">soa</i> meanwhile pays the girl elaborate
    and ostentatious court and in undertones pleads the cause of his
    friend. After dinner, the centre of the house is accorded the young
    people to play cards, sing or merely sit about, exchanging a series of
    broad pleasantries. This type of courtship varies from occasional calls
    to daily attendance. The food gift need not accompany each visit, but
    is as essential at the initial call as is an introduction in the West.
    The way of such declared lovers is hard. The girl does not wish to
    marry, nor to curtail her amours in deference to a definite betrothal.
    Possibly she may also dislike her suitor, while he in turn may be the
    victim of family ambition. Now that the whole village knows him for her
    suitor, the girl gratifies her vanity by avoidance, by perverseness.
    He comes in the evening, she has gone to another house; he follows her
    there, she immediately returns home. When such courtship ripens into
    an accepted proposal of marriage, the boy often goes to sleep in the
    house of his intended bride and often the union is surreptitiously
    consummated. Ceremonial marriage is deferred until such time as the
    boy’s family have planted or collected enough food and other property
    and the girl’s family have gotten together a suitable dowry of tapa and
    mats.</p>

  <p>In such manner are conducted the love affairs of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>average young
    people of the same village, and of the plebeian young people of
    neighbouring villages. From this free and easy experimentation, the
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i> is excepted. Virginity is a legal requirement for her.
    At her marriage, in front of all the people, in a house brilliantly
    lit, the talking chief of the bridegroom will take the tokens of her
    virginity.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In former days should she prove not to be a virgin, her
    female relatives fell upon and beat her with stones, disfiguring and
    sometimes fatally injuring the girl who had shamed their house. The
    public ordeal sometimes prostrated the girl for as much as a week,
    although ordinarily a girl recovers from first intercourse in two or
    three hours, and women seldom lie abed more than a few hours after
    childbirth. Although this virginity-testing ceremony was theoretically
    observed at weddings of people of all ranks, it was simply ignored if
    the boy knew that it was an idle form, and “a wise girl who is not a
    virgin will tell the talking chief of her husband, so that she be not
    shamed before all the people.”</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> This custom is now forbidden by law, but is only gradually
      dying out.
  </div>

  <p>The attitude towards virginity is a curious one. Christianity has, of
    course, introduced a moral premium on chastity. The Samoans regard
    this attitude with reverent but complete scepticism and the concept of
    celibacy is absolutely meaningless to them. But virginity definitely
    adds to a girl’s attractiveness, the wooing of a virgin is considered
    far more of a feat than <span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>the conquest of a more experienced heart,
    and a really successful Don Juan turns most of his attention to their
    seduction. One youth who at twenty-four married a girl who was still a
    virgin was the laughing stock of the village over his freely related
    trepidation which revealed the fact that at twenty-four, although he
    had had many love affairs, he had never before won the favours of a
    virgin.</p>

  <p>The bridegroom, his relatives and the bride and her relatives all
    receive prestige if she proves to be a virgin, so that the girl of rank
    who might wish to forestall this painful public ceremony is thwarted
    not only by the anxious chaperonage of her relatives but by the boy’s
    eagerness for prestige. One young Lothario eloped to his father’s house
    with a girl of high rank from another village and refused to live
    with her because, said he, “I thought maybe I would marry that girl
    and there would be a big <i lang="sm">malaga</i> and a big ceremony and I would
    wait and get the credit for marrying a virgin. But the next day her
    father came and said that she could not marry me, and she cried very
    much. So I said to her, ‘Well, there is no use now to wait any longer.
    Now we will run away into the bush.’” It is conceivable that the girl
    would often trade the temporary prestige for an escape from the public
    ordeal, but in proportion as his ambitions were honourable, the boy
    would frustrate her efforts.</p>

  <p>Just as the clandestine and casual “love under the palm trees” is the
    pattern irregularity for those of humble <span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>birth, so the elopement has
    its archetype in the love affairs of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, and the other
    chiefs’ daughters. These girls of noble birth are carefully guarded;
    not for them are secret trysts at night or stolen meetings in the day
    time. Where parents of lower rank complacently ignore their daughters’
    experiments, the high chief guards his daughter’s virginity as he
    guards the honour of his name, his precedence in the kava ceremony
    or any other prerogative of his high degree. Some old woman of the
    household is told off to be the girl’s constant companion and duenna.
    The <i lang="sm">taupo</i> may not visit in other houses in the village, or leave
    the house alone at night. When she sleeps, an older woman sleeps by
    her side. Never may she go to another village unchaperoned. In her own
    village she goes soberly about her tasks, bathing in the sea, working
    in the plantation, safe under the jealous guardianship of the women of
    her own village. She runs little risk from the <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, for
    one who outraged the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> of his village would formerly have
    been beaten to death, and now would have to flee from the village.
    The prestige of the village is inextricably bound up with the high
    repute of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and few young men in the village would
    dare to be her lovers. Marriage to them is out of the question, and
    their companions would revile them as traitors rather than envy them
    such doubtful distinction. Occasionally a youth of very high rank
    in the same village will risk an elopement, but even this is a rare
    occurrence. For <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>tradition says that the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> must marry
    outside her village, marry a high chief or a <i lang="sm">manaia</i> of another
    village. Such a marriage is an occasion for great festivities and
    solemn ceremony. The chief and all of his talking chiefs must come to
    propose for her hand, come in person bringing gifts for her talking
    chiefs. If the talking chiefs of the girl are satisfied that this is a
    lucrative and desirable match, and the family are satisfied with the
    rank and appearance of the suitor, the marriage is agreed upon. Little
    attention is paid to the opinion of the girl. So fixed is the idea that
    the marriage of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> is the affair of the talking chiefs
    that Europeanised natives on the main island, refuse to make their
    daughters <i lang="sm">taupos</i> because the missionaries say a girl should
    make her own choice, and once she is a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, they regard the
    matter as inevitably taken out of their hands. After the betrothal is
    agreed upon the bridegroom returns to his village to collect food and
    property for the wedding. His village sets aside a piece of land which
    is called the “Place of the Lady” and is her property and the property
    of her children forever, and on this land they build a house for the
    bride. Meanwhile, the bridegroom has left behind him in the house of
    the bride, a talking chief, the counterpart of the humbler <i lang="sm">soa</i>.
    This is one of the talking chief’s best opportunities to acquire
    wealth. He stays as the emissary of his chief, to watch over his future
    bride. He works for the bride’s family and each week the <i lang="sm">matai</i>
    of the bride must reward him with a handsome <span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>present. As an affianced
    wife of a chief, more and more circumspect conduct is enjoined upon
    the girl. Did she formerly joke with the boys of the village, she must
    joke no longer, or the talking chief, on the watch for any lapse from
    high decorum, will go home to his chief and report that his bride is
    unworthy of such honour. This custom is particularly susceptible to
    second thought on the part of either side. Does the bridegroom repent
    of the bargain, he bribes his talking chief (who is usually a young
    man, not one of the important talking chiefs who will benefit greatly
    by the marriage itself) to be oversensitive to the behaviour of the
    bride or the treatment he receives in the bride’s family. And this is
    the time in which the bride will elope, if her affianced husband is
    too unacceptable. For while no boy of her own village will risk her
    dangerous favours, a boy from another village will enormously enhance
    his prestige if he elopes with the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> of a rival community.
    Once she has eloped, the projected alliance is of course broken off,
    although her angry parents may refuse to sanction her marriage with her
    lover and marry her for punishment to some old man.</p>

  <p>So great is the prestige won by the village, one of whose young men
    succeeds in eloping with a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, that often the whole effort
    of a <i lang="sm">malaga</i> is concentrated upon abducting the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>,
    whose virginity will be respected in direct ratio to the chances of
    her family and village consenting to ratify the marriage. As the
    abductor is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>often of high rank, the village often ruefully accepts the
    compromise.</p>

  <p>This elopement pattern, given meaning by the restrictions under which
    the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> lives and this inter-village rivalry, is carried down
    to the lower ranks where indeed it is practically meaningless. Seldom
    is the chaperonage exercised over the girl of average family severe
    enough to make elopement the only way of consummating a love affair.
    But the elopement is spectacular; the boy wishes to increase his
    reputation as a successful Don Juan, and the girl wishes to proclaim
    her conquest and also often hopes that the elopement will end in
    marriage. The eloping pair run away to the parents of the boy or to
    some of his relatives and wait for the girl’s relatives to pursue her.
    As one boy related the tale of such an adventure: “We ran away in the
    rain, nine miles to Leone, in the pouring rain, to my father’s house.
    The next day her family came to get her, and my father said to me,
    ‘How is it, do you wish to marry this girl, shall I ask her father to
    leave her here?’ And I said, ‘Oh, no. I just eloped with her for public
    information.’” Elopements are much less frequent than the clandestine
    love affairs because the girl takes far more risk. She publicly
    renounces her often nominal claims to virginity; she embroils herself
    with her family, who in former times, and occasionally even to-day,
    would beat her soundly and shave off her hair. Nine times out of ten,
    her lover’s only motive is vanity <span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>and display, for the boy’s say,
    “The girls hate a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, but they all love an <i lang="sm">avaga</i>
    (eloping) man.”</p>

  <p>The elopement also occurs as a practical measure when one family
    is opposed to a marriage upon which a pair of young people have
    determined. The young people take refuge with the friendly side of the
    family. But unless the recalcitrant family softens and consents to
    legalise the marriage by a formal exchange of property, the principals
    can do nothing to establish their status. A young couple may have had
    several children and still be classed as “elopers,” and if the marriage
    is finally legalised after long delay, this stigma will always cling
    to them. It is far more serious a one than a mere accusation of sexual
    irregularity, for there is a definite feeling that the whole community
    procedure has been outraged by a pair of young upstarts.</p>

  <p>Reciprocal gift-giving relations are maintained between the two
    families as long as the marriage lasts, and even afterwards if there
    are children. The birth of each child, the death of a member of either
    household, a visit of the wife to her family, or if he lives with her
    people, of the husband to his, is marked by the presentation of gifts.</p>

  <p>In premarital relationships, a convention of love making is strictly
    adhered to. True, this is a convention of speech, rather than of
    action. A boy declares that he will die if a girl refuses him her
    favours, but the Samoans laugh at stories of romantic love, scoff at
    fidelity to a long absent wife or mistress, believe explicitly that
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>one love will quickly cure another. The fidelity which is followed by
    pregnancy is taken as proof positive of a real attachment, although
    having many mistresses is never out of harmony with a declaration
    of affection for each. The composition of ardent love songs, the
    fashioning of long and flowery love letters, the invocation of the
    moon, the stars and the sea in verbal courtship, all serve to give
    Samoan love-making a close superficial resemblance to our own, yet
    the attitude is far closer to that of Schnitzler’s hero in <cite>The
    Affairs of Anatol</cite>. Romantic love as it occurs in our civilisation,
    inextricably bound up with ideas of monogamy, exclusiveness, jealousy
    and undeviating fidelity does not occur in Samoa. Our attitude is a
    compound, the final result of many converging lines of development in
    Western civilisation, of the institution of monogamy, of the ideas of
    the age of chivalry, of the ethics of Christianity. Even a passionate
    attachment to one person which lasts for a long period and persists in
    the face of discouragement but does not bar out other relationships,
    is rare among the Samoans. Marriage, on the other hand, is regarded as
    a social and economic arrangement, in which relative wealth, rank, and
    skill of husband and wife, all must be taken into consideration. There
    are many marriages in which both individuals, especially if they are
    over thirty, are completely faithful. But this must be attributed to
    the ease of sexual adjustment on the one hand, and to the ascendency
    of other interests, social organisation for the men, children <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>for the
    women, over sex interests, rather than to a passionate fixation upon
    the partner in the marriage. As the Samoans lack the inhibitions and
    the intricate specialisation of sex feeling which make marriages of
    convenience unsatisfactory, it is possible to bulwark marital happiness
    with other props than temporary passionate devotion. Suitability and
    expediency become the deciding factors.</p>

  <p>Adultery does not necessarily mean a broken marriage. A chief’s wife
    who commits adultery is deemed to have dishonoured her high position,
    and is usually discarded, although the chief will openly resent her
    remarriage to any one of lower rank. If the lover is considered the
    more culpable, the village will take public vengeance upon him. In
    less conspicuous cases the amount of fuss which is made over adultery
    is dependent upon the relative rank of the offender and offended, or
    the personal jealousy which is only occasionally aroused. If either
    the injured husband or the injured wife is sufficiently incensed to
    threaten physical violence, the trespasser may have to resort to a
    public <i lang="sm">ifoga</i>, the ceremonial humiliation before some one whose
    pardon is asked. He goes to the house of the man he has injured,
    accompanied by all the men of his household, each one wrapped in a
    fine mat, the currency of the country; the suppliants seat themselves
    outside the house, fine mats spread over their heads, hands folded on
    their breasts, heads bent in attitudes of the deepest dejection and
    humiliation. “And if the man is <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>very angry he will say no word. All
    day he will go about his business; he will braid cinet with a quick
    hand, he will talk loudly to his wife, and call out greetings to those
    who pass in the roadway, but he will take no notice of those who sit
    on his own terrace, who dare not raise their eyes or make any movement
    to go away. In olden days, if his heart was not softened, he might
    take a club and together with his relatives go out and kill those who
    sit without. But now he only keeps them waiting, waiting all day long.
    The sun will beat down upon them; the rain will come and beat on their
    heads and still he will say no word. Then towards evening he will say
    at last: ‘Come, it is enough. Enter the house and drink the kava. Eat
    the food which I will set before you and we will cast our trouble into
    the sea.’” Then the fine mats are accepted as payment for the injury,
    the <i lang="sm">ifoga</i> becomes a matter of village history and old gossips
    will say, “Oh, yes, Lua! no, she’s not Iona’s child. Her father is
    that chief over in the next village. He <i lang="sm">ifod</i> to Iona before
    she was born.” If the offender is of much lower rank than the injured
    husband, his chief, or his father (if he is only a young boy) will have
    to humiliate himself in his place. Where the offender is a woman, she
    and her female relatives will make similar amends. But they will run
    far greater danger of being roundly beaten and berated; the peaceful
    teachings of Christianity—perhaps because they were directed against
    actual killing, rather than the slightly less fatal encounters of
    women—have made far less <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>change in the belligerent activities of the
    women than in those of the men.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, a wife really tires of her husband, or a husband
    of his wife, divorce is a simple and informal matter, the non-resident
    simply going home to his or her family, and the relationship is said to
    have “passed away.” It is a very brittle monogamy, often trespassed and
    more often broken entirely. But many adulteries occur—between a young
    marriage-shy bachelor and a married woman, or a temporary widower and
    some young girl—which hardly threaten the continuity of established
    relationships. The claim that a woman has on her family’s land renders
    her as independent as her husband, and so there are no marriages of any
    duration in which either person is actively unhappy. A tiny flare-up
    and a woman goes home to her own people; if her husband does not care
    to conciliate her, each seeks another mate.</p>

  <p>Within the family, the wife obeys and serves her husband, in theory,
    though of course, the hen-pecked husband is a frequent phenomenon. In
    families of high rank, her personal service to her husband is taken
    over by the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and the talking chief but the wife always
    retains the right to render a high chief sacred personal services,
    such as cutting his hair. A wife’s rank can never exceed her husband’s
    because it is always directly dependent upon it. Her family may be
    richer and more illustrious than his, and she may actually exercise
    more influence over the village affairs through her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>blood relatives
    than he, but within the life of the household and the village, she is
    a <i lang="sm">tausi</i>, wife of a talking chief, or a <i lang="sm">faletua</i>, wife of
    a chief. This sometimes results in conflict, as in the case of Pusa
    who was the sister of the last holder of the highest title on the
    island. This title was temporarily extinct. She was also the wife of
    the highest chief in the village. Should her brother, the heir, resume
    the higher title, her husband’s rank and her rank as his wife would
    suffer. Helping her brother meant lowering the prestige of her husband.
    As she was the type of woman who cared a great deal more for wire
    pulling than for public recognition, she threw her influence in for her
    brother. Such conflicts are not uncommon, but they present a clear-cut
    choice, usually reinforced by considerations of residence. If a woman
    lives in her husband’s household, and if, furthermore, that household
    is in another village, her interest is mainly enlisted in her husband’s
    cause; but if she lives with her own family, in her own village, her
    allegiance is likely to cling to the blood relatives from whom she
    receives reflected glory and informal privilege, although no status.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE RÔLE OF THE DANCE</div>

  <p>Dancing is the only activity in which almost all ages and both sexes
    participate and it therefore offers a unique opportunity for an
    analysis of education.</p>

  <p>In the dance there are virtuosos but no formal teachers. It is a highly
    individual activity set in a social framework. This framework varies
    from a small dancing party at which twelve to twenty people are present
    to the major festivities of a <i lang="sm">malaga</i> (travelling party) or a
    wedding when the largest guest house in the village is crowded within
    and encircled by spectators without. With the size and importance of
    the festivity, the formality of the arrangements varies also. Usually
    the occasion of even a small <i lang="sm">siva</i> (dance) is the presence of
    at least two or three strange young people from another village. The
    pattern entertainment is a division of the performers into visitors and
    hosts, the two sides taking turns in providing the music and dancing.
    This pattern is still followed even when the <i lang="sm">malaga</i> numbers only
    two individuals, a number of hosts going over to swell the visitors’
    ranks.</p>

  <p>It is at these small informal dances that the children learn to dance.
    In the front of the house sit the young people who are the centre and
    arbiters of the occasion. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>The <i lang="sm">matai</i> and his wife and possibly
    a related <i lang="sm">matai</i> and the other elders of the household sit at
    the back of the house, in direct reversal of the customary procedure
    according to which the place of the young people is in the background.
    Around the ends cluster women and children, and outside lurk the
    boys and girls who are not participating in the dancing, although at
    any moment they may be drawn into it. On such occasions the dancing
    is usually started by the small children, beginning possibly with
    seven- and eight-year-olds. The chief’s wife or one of the young men
    will call out the names of the children and they are stood up in a
    group of three, sometimes all boys or girls, sometimes with a girl
    between two boys, which is the conventional adult grouping for the
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i> and her two talking chiefs. The young men, sitting in a
    group near the centre of the house, provide the music, one of them
    standing and leading the singing to the accompaniment of an imported
    stringed instrument which has taken the place of the rude bamboo drum
    of earlier times. The leader sets the key and the whole company join
    in either in the song, or by clapping, or by beating on the floor
    with their knuckles. The dancers themselves are the final arbiters of
    the excellence of the music and it is not counted as petulance for
    a dancer to stop in the middle and demand better music as the price
    of continuing. The songs sung are few in number; the young people of
    one village seldom know more than a dozen airs; and perhaps twice as
    many sets of words which are sung now <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>to one air, now to another. The
    verse pattern is simply based upon the number of syllables; a change in
    stress is permitted and rhyme is not demanded so that any new event is
    easily set in the old pattern, and names of villages and of individuals
    are inserted with great freedom. The content of the songs is likely to
    take on an extremely personal character containing many quips at the
    expense of individuals and their villages.</p>

  <p>The form of the participation of the audience changes according to the
    age of the dancers. In the case of the smaller children, it consists
    of an endless stream of good-natured comment: “Faster!” “Down lower!
    Lower!” “Do it again!” “Fasten your <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>.” In the dancing of
    the more expert boys and girls the group takes part by a steady murmur
    of “Thank you, thank you, for your dancing!” “Beautiful! Engaging!
    Charming! Bravo!” which gives very much the effect of the irregular
    stream of “Amens” at an evangelistic revival. This articulate courtesy
    becomes almost lyric in quality when the dancer is a person of rank for
    whom dancing at all is a condescension.</p>

  <p>The little children are put out upon these public floors with a minimum
    of preliminary instruction. As babies in their mothers’ arms at just
    such a party as this, they learned to clap before they learned to
    walk, so that the beat is indelibly fixed in their minds. As two- and
    three-year-olds they have stood on a mat at home and clapped their
    hands in time to their elders’ singing. Now they are called upon to
    perform before a group. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>Wide-eyed, terrified babies stand beside
    some slightly older child, clapping in desperation and trying to add
    new steps borrowed on the spur of the moment from their companions.
    Every improvement is greeted with loud applause. The child who
    performed best at the last party is haled forward at the next, for
    the group is primarily interested in its own amusement rather than in
    distributing an equal amount of practice among the children. Hence some
    children rapidly outdistance the rest, through interest and increased
    opportunity as well as superior gift. This tendency to give the
    talented child another and another chance is offset somewhat by rivalry
    between relatives who wish to thrust their little ones forward.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>While the children are dancing, the older boys and girls are
    refurbishing their costumes with flowers, shell necklaces, anklets and
    bracelets of leaves. One or two will probably slip off home and return
    dressed in elaborate bark skirts. A bottle of cocoanut oil is produced
    from the family chest and rubbed on the bodies of the older dancers.
    Should a person of rank be present and consent to dance, the hostess
    family bring out their finest mats and tapas as costume. Sometimes this
    impromptu dressing assumes such importance that an adjoining house is
    taken over as a dressing room; at others it is of so informal a nature
    that spectators, who have gathered outside arrayed only in sheets, have
    to borrow a dress or a <i lang="sm">lavalava</i> from some other spectator before
    they can appear on the dance floor. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>The form of the dance itself is
    eminently individualistic. No figures are prescribed except the half
    dozen formal little claps which open the dance and the use of one of a
    few set endings. There are twenty-five or thirty figures, two or three
    set transitional positions, and at least three definite styles, the
    dance of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, the dance of the boys, and the dance of the
    jesters. These three styles relate definitely to the kind of dance and
    not to the status of the dancer. The <i lang="sm">taupo’s</i> dance is grave,
    aloof, beautiful. She is required to preserve a set, dreamy, nonchalant
    expression of infinite hauteur and detachment. The only permissible
    alternative to this expression is a series of grimaces, impudent rather
    than comic in nature and deriving their principal appeal from the
    strong contrast which they present to the more customary gravity. The
    <i lang="sm">manaia</i> also when he dances in his <i lang="sm">manaia</i> rôle is required
    to follow this same decorous and dignified pattern. Most little girls
    and a few little boys pattern their dancing on this convention. Chiefs,
    on the rare occasions when they consent to dance, and older women
    of rank have the privilege of choosing between this style and the
    adoption of a comedian’s rôle. The boys’ dance is much jollier than
    the girls’. There is much greater freedom of movement and a great deal
    of emphasis on the noise made by giving rapid rhythmical slaps to the
    unclothed portions of the body which produce a crackling tattoo of
    sound. This style is neither salacious nor languorous although the
    <i lang="sm">taupo’s</i> dance is often both. It is athletic, slightly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>rowdy,
    exuberant, and owes much of its appeal to the feats of rapid and
    difficult co-ordination which the slapping involves. The jester’s
    dance is peculiarly the dance of those who dance upon either side of
    the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, or the <i lang="sm">manaia</i>, and honour them by mocking
    them. It is primarily the prerogative of talking chiefs and old men
    and old women in general. The original motive is contrast; the jester
    provides comic relief for the stately dance of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, and
    the higher the rank of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, the higher the rank of the men
    and women who will condescend to act as clownish foils to her ability.
    The dancing of these jesters is characterised by burlesque, horseplay,
    exaggeration of the stereotyped figures, a great deal of noise made by
    hammering on the open mouth with spread palm, and a large amount of
    leaping about and pounding on the floor. The clown is occasionally so
    proficient that he takes the centre of the floor on these ceremonious
    occasions.</p>

  <p>The little girl who is learning to dance has these three styles from
    which to choose, she has twenty-five or thirty figures from which to
    compose her dance and most important of all she has the individual
    dancers to watch. My first interpretation of the skill of the younger
    children was that they each took an older boy or girl as a model and
    sedulously and slavishly copied the whole dance. But I was not able to
    find a single instance in which a child would admit or seemed in any
    way conscious of having copied another; nor did I find, after closer
    familiarity with the group, any <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>younger child whose style of dancing
    could definitely be referred to the imitation of another dancer. The
    style of every dancer of any virtuosity is known to every one in the
    village and when it is copied, it is copied conspicuously so that
    Vaitogi, the little girl who places her forearms parallel with the top
    of her head, her palms flat on her head, and advances in a stooping
    position, uttering hissing sounds, will be said to be dancing <i>a la
    Sina</i>. There is no stigma upon such imitation; the author does not
    resent it nor particularly glory in it; the crowd does not upbraid
    it; but so strong is the feeling for individualisation that a dancer
    will seldom introduce more than one such feature into an evening’s
    performance; and when the dancing of two girls is similar, it is
    similar in spite of the efforts of both, rather than because of any
    attempt at imitation. Naturally, the dancing of the young children is
    much more similar than the dancing of the young men and girls who had
    had time and opportunity really to perfect a style.</p>

  <p>The attitude of the elders towards precocity in singing, leading
    the singing or dancing, is in striking contrast to their attitude
    towards every other form of precocity. On the dance floor the dreaded
    accusation, “You are presuming above your age,” is never heard. Little
    boys who would be rebuked and possibly whipped for such behaviour
    on any other occasion are allowed to preen themselves, to swagger
    and bluster and take the limelight without a word of reproach. The
    relatives crow with delight over a precocity for which they <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>would hide
    their heads in shame were it displayed in any other sphere.</p>

  <p>It is on these semi-formal occasions that the dance really serves as an
    educational factor. The highly ceremonious dance of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> or
    <i lang="sm">manaia</i> and their talking chiefs at a wedding or a <i lang="sm">malaga</i>,
    with its elaborate costuming, compulsory distribution of gifts,
    and its vigilant attention to precedent and prerogative, offers no
    opportunities to the amateur or the child. They may only cluster
    outside the guest house and watch the proceedings. The existence of
    such a heavily stylized and elaborate archetype of course serves an
    additional function in giving zest as well as precedent to the informal
    occasions which partially ape its grandeur.</p>

  <p>The significance of the dance in the education and socialisation of
    Samoan children is two-fold. In the first place it effectively offsets
    the rigorous subordination in which children are habitually kept.
    Here the admonitions of the elders change from “Sit down and keep
    still!” to “Stand up and dance!” The children are actually the centre
    of the group instead of its barely tolerated fringes. The parents
    and relatives distribute generous praise by way of emphasising their
    children’s superiority over the children of their neighbours or their
    visitors. The ubiquitous ascendency of age is somewhat relaxed in
    the interests of greater proficiency. Each child is a person with a
    definite contribution to make regardless of sex and age. This emphasis
    on individuality is carried to limits which seriously mar the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>dance
    as an æsthetic performance. The formal adult dance with its row of
    dancers, the <i lang="sm">taupo</i> in the centre and an even number of dancers
    on each side focussed upon her with every movement directed towards
    accentuating her dancing, loses both symmetry and unity in the
    hands of the ambitious youngsters. Each dancer moves in a glorious
    individualistic oblivion of the others, there is no pretence of
    co-ordination or of subordinating the wings to the centre of the line.
    Often a dancer does not pay enough attention to her fellow dancers
    to avoid continually colliding with them. It is a genuine orgy of
    aggressive individualistic exhibitionism. This tendency, so blatantly
    displayed on these informal occasions, does not mar the perfection of
    the occasional formal dance when the solemnity of the occasion becomes
    a sufficient check upon the participants’ aggressiveness. The formal
    dance is of personal significance only to people of rank or to the
    virtuoso to whom it presents a perfect occasion for display.</p>

  <p>The second influence of the dance is its reduction of the threshold
    of shyness. There is as much difference between one Samoan child and
    another in the matter of shyness and self-consciousness as is apparent
    among our children, but where our shyest children avoid the limelight
    altogether, the Samoan child looks pained and anxious but dances just
    the same. The limelight is regarded as inevitable and the child makes
    at least a minimum of effort to meet its requirements by standing up
    and going through a certain number of motions. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>beneficial effects
    of this early habituation to the public eye and the resulting control
    of the body are more noticeable in the case of boys than of girls.
    Fifteen- and sixteen-year-old boys dance with a charm and a complete
    lack of self-consciousness which is a joy to watch. The adolescent girl
    whose gawky, awkward gait and lack of co-ordination may be appalling,
    becomes a graceful, self-possessed person upon the dance floor. But
    this ease and poise does not seem to be carried over into everyday life
    with the same facility as it is in the case of young boys.</p>

  <p>In one way this informal dance floor approximates more closely to our
    educational methods than does any other aspect of Samoan education. For
    here the precocious child is applauded, made much of, given more and
    more opportunities to show its proficiency while the stupid child is
    rebuked, neglected and pushed to the wall. This difference in permitted
    practice is reflected in increasing differences in the skill of the
    children as they grow older. Inferiority feeling in the classic picture
    which is so frequent in our society is rare in Samoa. Inferiority there
    seems to be derived from two sources, clumsiness in sex relations
    which affects the young men after they are grown and produces the
    <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, and clumsiness upon the dance floor. I have already
    told the story of the little girl, shy beyond her fellows, whom
    prospective high rank had forced into the limelight and made miserably
    diffident and self-conscious.</p>

  <p>And the most unhappy of the older girls was Masina, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>a girl about three
    years past puberty. Masina could not dance. Every one in the village
    knew that she could not dance. Her contemporaries deplored it; the
    younger children made fun of her. She had little charm, was deprecating
    in her manner, awkward, shy and ill at ease. All of her five lovers had
    been casual, all temporary, all unimportant. She associated with girls
    much younger than herself. She had no self-confidence. No one sought
    her hand in marriage and she would not marry until her family needed
    the kind of property which forms a bride price.</p>

  <p>It is interesting to notice that the one aspect of life in which the
    elders actively discriminate against the less proficient children seems
    to be the most powerful determinant in giving the children a feeling of
    inferiority.</p>

  <p>The strong emphasis upon dancing does not discriminate against the
    physically defective. Instead every defect is capitalised in the form
    of the dance or compensated for by the perfection of the dance. I saw
    one badly hunchbacked boy who had worked out a most ingenious imitation
    of a turtle and also a combination dance with another boy in which
    the other supported him on his back. Ipu, the little albino, danced
    with aggressive facility and with much applause, while mad Laki, who
    suffered from a delusion that he was the high chief of the island,
    was only too delighted to dance for any one who addressed him with
    the elaborate courtesy phrases suitable to his rank. The dumb brother
    of the high chief of one village utilised his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>deaf mute gutturals
    as a running accompaniment to his dance, while the brothers of a
    fourteen-year-old feeble-minded mad boy were accustomed to deck his
    head with branches which excited him to a frenzied rhythmical activity,
    suggesting a stag whose antlers had been caught in the bush. The most
    precocious girl dancer in Taū was almost blind. So every defect, every
    handicap was included in this universal, specialised exploitation of
    personality.</p>

  <p>The dancing child is almost always a very different person from her
    everyday self. After long acquaintance it is sometimes possible to
    guess the type of dance which a particular girl will do. This is
    particularly easy in the case of obviously tom-boy girls, but one is
    continually fooled by the depths of sophistication in the dancing
    of some pensive, dull child, or the lazy grace of some noisy little
    hoodlum.</p>

  <p>Formal dancing displays are a recognised social entertainment and
    the highest courtesy a chief can offer his guest is to have his
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i> dance for him. So likewise the boys dance after they have
    been tattooed, the <i lang="sm">manaia</i> dances when he goes to woo his bride,
    the bride dances at her wedding. In the midnight conviviality of a
    <i lang="sm">malaga</i> the dance often becomes flagrantly obscene and definitely
    provocative in character, but both of these are special developments
    of less importance than the function of informal dancing in the
    development of individuality and the compensation for repression of
    personality in other spheres of life.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE ATTITUDE TOWARDS PERSONALITY</div>

  <p>The ease with which personality differences can be adjusted by a change
    of residence prevents the Samoans from pressing one another too hard.
    Their evaluations of personality are a curious mixture of caution and
    fatalism. There is one word <i lang="sm">musu</i> which expresses unwillingness
    and intractability, whether in the mistress who refuses to welcome a
    hitherto welcome lover, the chief who refuses to lend his kava bowl,
    the baby who won’t go to bed, or the talking chief who won’t go on a
    <i lang="sm">malaga</i>. The appearance of a <i lang="sm">musu</i> attitude is treated
    with almost superstitious respect. Lovers will prescribe formulæ for
    the treatment of a mistress, “lest she become <i lang="sm">musu</i>,” and the
    behaviour of the suppliant is carefully orientated in respect to this
    mysterious undesirability. The feeling seems to be not that one is
    dealing with an individual in terms of his peculiar preoccupations
    in order to assure a successful outcome of a personal relationship,
    appealing now to vanity, now to fear, now to a desire for power, but
    rather that one is using one or another of a series of potent practices
    to prevent a mysterious and widespread psychological phenomenon from
    arising. Once this attitude has appeared, a Samoan habitually gives
    up the struggle without more <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>detailed inquiry and with a minimum
    of complaint. This fatalistic acceptance of an inexplicable attitude
    makes for an odd incuriousness about motives. The Samoans are not in
    the least insensitive to differences between people. But their full
    appreciation of these differences is blurred by their conception of
    an obstinate disposition, a tendency to take umbrage, irascibility,
    contra-suggestibility, and particular biases as just so many roads to
    one attitude—<i lang="sm">musu</i>.</p>

  <figure class="illowp68">
    <img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" id="i_122">
    <figcaption><i>A spirit of the wood</i></figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>This lack of curiosity about motivation is furthered by the
    conventional acceptance of a completely ambiguous answer to any
    personal question. The most characteristic reply to any question about
    one’s motivation is <i lang="sm">Ta ilo</i>, “search me,” sometimes made more
    specific by the addition of “I don’t know.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This is considered to be
    an adequate and acceptable answer in ordinary conversation although its
    slight curtness bars it out from ceremonious occasions. So deep seated
    is the habit of using this disclaimer that I had to put a taboo upon
    its use by the children in order to get the simplest question answered
    directly. When this ambiguous rejoinder is combined with a statement
    that one is <i lang="sm">musu</i>, the result is the final unrevealing statement,
    “Search me, why, I don’t want to, that’s all.” Plans will be abandoned,
    children refuse to live at home, marriages broken off. Village gossip
    is interested in the fact but shrugs its shoulders before the motives.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> See Appendix I, <a href="#Page_253">page 253</a>.
  </div>

  <p>There is one curious exception to this attitude. If <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>an individual
    falls ill, the explanation is sought first in the attitudes of his
    relatives. Anger in the heart of a relative, especially in that of a
    sister, is most potent in producing evil and so the whole household
    is convened, a kava ceremony held and each relative solemnly enjoined
    to confess what anger there is in his heart against the sick person.
    Such injunctions are met either by solemn disclaimers or by detailed
    confessions: “Last week my brother came into the house and ate all the
    food, and I was angry all day”; or “My brother and I had a quarrel
    and my father took my brother’s side and I was angry at my father for
    his favouritism towards my brother.” But this special ceremony only
    serves to throw into strong relief the prevalent unspeculative attitude
    towards motivation. I once saw a girl leave a week-end fishing party
    immediately upon arrival at our destination and insist upon returning
    in the heat of the day the six miles to the village. But her companions
    ventured no hypothesis; she was simply <i lang="sm">musu</i> to the party.</p>

  <p>How great a protection for the individual such an attitude is will
    readily be seen when it is remembered how little privacy any one has.
    Chief or child, he dwells habitually in a house with at least half a
    dozen other people. His possessions are simply rolled in a mat, placed
    on the rafters or piled carelessly into a basket or a chest. A chief’s
    personal property is likely to be respected, at least by the women of
    the household, but no one else can be sure from hour to hour of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>his
    nominal possessions. The tapa which a woman spent three weeks in making
    will be given away to a visitor during her temporary absence. The rings
    may be begged off her fingers at any moment. Privacy of possessions is
    virtually impossible. In the same way, all of an individual’s acts are
    public property. An occasional love affair may slip through the fingers
    of gossip, and an occasional <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> go uncaught, but there
    is a very general cognisance on the part of the whole village of the
    activity of every single inhabitant. I shall never forget the outraged
    expression with which an informant told me that nobody, actually nobody
    at all, knew who was the father of Fa’amoana’s baby. The oppressive
    atmosphere of the small town is all about them; in an hour children
    will have made a dancing song of their most secret acts. This glaring
    publicity is compensated for by a violent gloomy secretiveness. Where a
    Westerner would say, “Yes, I love him but you’ll never know how far it
    went,” a Samoan would say, “Yes, of course I lived with him, but you’ll
    never know whether I love him or hate him.”</p>

  <p>The Samoan language has no regular comparative. There are several
    clumsy ways of expressing comparison by using contrast, “This is
    good and that is bad”; or by the locution, “And next to him there
    comes, etc.” Comparisons are not habitual although in the rigid
    social structure of the community, relative rank is very keenly
    recognised. But relative goodness, relative beauty, relative wisdom
    are unfamiliar formalisations <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>to them. I tried over and over again
    to get judgments as to who was the wisest or the best man of the
    community. An informant’s first impulse was always to answer: “Oh, they
    are all good”; or, “There are so many wise ones.” Curiously enough,
    there seemed to be less difficulty in distinguishing the vicious
    than the virtuous. This is probably due to the Missionary influence
    which if it has failed to give the native a conviction of Sin, has
    at least provided him with a list of sins. Although I often met with
    a preliminary response, “There are so many bad boys”; it was usually
    qualified spontaneously by “But so-and-so is the worst because he ...”
    Ugliness and viciousness were more vivid and unusual attributes of
    personality; beauty, wisdom, and kindness were taken for granted.</p>

  <p>In an account given of another person the sequence of traits mentioned
    followed a set and objective pattern: sex, age, rank, relationship,
    defects, activities. Spontaneous comment upon character or personality
    were unusual. So a girl describes her grandmother: “Lauuli? Oh, she is
    an old woman, very old, she’s my father’s mother. She’s a widow with
    one eye. She is too old to go inland but sits in the house all day. She
    makes tapa.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> This completely unanalytical account is only modified
    in the case of exceptionally intelligent adults who are asked to make
    judgments.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">[5]</a> For additional character sketches see Appendix I, <a href="#Page_253">page 253</a>.
  </div>

  <p>In the native classification attitudes are qualified by four terms,
    good and bad, easy and difficult, paired. A <span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>good child will be said
    to listen easily or to act well, a bad child to listen with difficulty
    or act badly. “Easy” and “with difficulty” are judgments of character;
    “good” and “bad” of behaviour. So that good or bad behaviour have
    become, explained in terms of ease or difficulty, to be regarded as an
    inherent capability of the individual. As we would say a person sang
    easily or swam without effort, the Samoan will say one obeys easily,
    acts respectfully, “easily,” reserving the terms “good” or “well”
    for objective approbation. So a chief who was commenting on the bad
    behaviour of his brother’s daughter remarked, “But Tui’s children
    always did listen with difficulty,” with as casual an acceptance of an
    irradicable defect as if he had said, “But John always did have poor
    eye sight.”</p>

  <p>Such an attitude towards conduct is paralleled by an equally unusual
    attitude towards the expression of emotion. The expressions of emotions
    are classified as “caused” and “uncaused.” The emotional, easily upset,
    moody person is described as laughing without cause, crying without
    cause, showing anger or pugnaciousness without cause. The expression
    “to be very angry without cause” does not carry the implication of
    quick temper, which is expressed by the word “to anger easily,” nor the
    connotation of a disproportionate response to a legitimate stimulus,
    but means literally to be angry without cause, or freely, an emotional
    state without any apparent stimulus whatsoever. Such judgments are the
    nearest that the Samoan approaches to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>evaluation of temperament as
    opposed to character. The well-integrated individual who approximates
    closely to the attitudes of his age and sex group is not accused of
    laughing, crying, or showing anger without cause. Without inquiry it is
    assumed that he has good typical reasons for a behaviour which would be
    scrutinised and scorned in the case of the temperamental deviant. And
    always excessive emotion, violent preferences, strong allegiances are
    disallowed. The Samoan preference is for a middle course, a moderate
    amount of feeling, a discreet expression of a reasonable and balanced
    attitude. Those who care greatly are always said to care without cause.</p>

  <p>The one most disliked trait in a contemporary is expressed by the term
    <i lang="sm">fiasili</i>, literally “desiring to be highest,” more idiomatically,
    “stuck up.” This is the comment of the age mate where an older person
    would use the disapproving <i lang="sm">tautala laititi</i>, “presuming above
    one’s age.” It is essentially the resentful comment of those who are
    ignored, neglected, left behind upon those who excel them, scorn them,
    pass them by. As a term of reproach it is neither as dreaded nor as
    resented as the <i lang="sm">tautala laititi</i> because envy is felt to play a
    part in the taunt.</p>

  <p>In the casual conversations, the place of idle speculation about
    motivation is taken by explanations in terms of physical defect or
    objective misfortune, thus “Sila is crying over in that house. Well,
    Sila is deaf.” “Tulipa is angry at her brother. Tulipa’s mother went
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>to Tutuila last week.” Although these statements have the earmarks of
    attempted explanations they are really only conversational habits. The
    physical defect or recent incident, is not specifically invoked but
    merely mentioned with slightly greater and more deprecatory emphasis.
    The whole preoccupation is with the individual as an actor, and the
    motivations peculiar to his psychology are left an unplumbed mystery.</p>

  <p>Judgments are always made in terms of age groups, from the standpoints
    of the group of the speaker and the age of the person judged. A young
    boy will not be regarded as an intelligent or stupid, attractive or
    unattractive, clumsy or skilful person. He is a bright little boy of
    nine who runs errands efficiently and is wise enough to hold his tongue
    when his elders are present, or a promising youth of eighteen who can
    make excellent speeches in the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, lead a fishing expedition
    with discretion and treat the chiefs with the respect which is due to
    them, or a wise <i lang="sm">matai</i>, whose words are few and well chosen and
    who is good at weaving eel traps. The virtues of the child are not the
    virtues of the adult. And the judgment of the speaker is similarly
    influenced by age, so that the relative estimation of character varies
    also. Pre-adolescent boys and girls will vote that boy and girl worst
    who are most pugnacious, irascible, contentious, rowdy. Young people
    from sixteen to twenty shift their censure from the rowdy and bully to
    the licentious, the <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i> among the boys, the notoriously
    promiscuous among the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>girls; while adults pay very little attention
    to sex offenders and stress instead the inept, the impudent and the
    disobedient among the young, and the lazy, the stupid, the quarrelsome
    and the unreliable as the least desirable characters among the adults.
    When an adult is speaking the standards of conduct are graded in
    this fashion: small children should keep quiet, wake up early, obey,
    work hard and cheerfully, play with children of their own sex; young
    people should work industriously and skilfully, not be presuming,
    marry discreetly, be loyal to their relatives, not carry tales, nor
    be trouble makers; while adults should be wise, peaceable, serene,
    generous, anxious for the good prestige of their village and conduct
    their lives with all good form and decorum. No prominence is given to
    the subtler facts of intelligence and temperament. Preference between
    the sexes is given not to the arrogant, the flippant, the courageous,
    but to the quiet, the demure boy or girl who “speaks softly and treads
    lightly.”</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE EXPERIENCE AND INDIVIDUALITY OF THE AVERAGE GIRL<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></div>

  <p>With a background of knowledge about Samoan custom, of the way in which
    a child is educated, of the claims which the community makes upon
    children and young people, of the attitude towards sex and personality,
    we come to the tale of the group of girls with whom I spent many
    months, the group of girls between ten and twenty years of age who
    lived in the three little villages on the lee side of the island of
    Taū. In their lives as a group, in their responses as individuals, lies
    the answer to the question: What is coming of age like in Samoa?</p>

  <p>The reader will remember that the principal activity of the little
    girls was baby-tending. They could also do reef fishing, weave a ball
    and make a pin-wheel, climb a cocoanut tree, keep themselves afloat
    in a swimming hole which changed its level fifteen feet with every
    wave, grate off the skin of a breadfruit or taro, sweep the sanded
    yard of the house, carry water from the sea, do simple washing and
    dance a somewhat individualised <i lang="sm">siva</i>. Their knowledge of the
    biology of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>life and death was overdeveloped in proportion to their
    knowledge of the organisation of their society or any of the niceties
    of conduct prescribed for their elders. They were in a position which
    would be paralleled in our culture if a child had seen birth and death
    before she was taught not to pass a knife blade first or how to make
    change for a quarter. None of these children could speak the courtesy
    language, even in its most elementary forms, their knowledge being
    confined to four or five words of invitation and acceptance. This
    ignorance effectually barred them from the conversations of their
    elders upon all ceremonial occasions. Spying upon a gathering of chiefs
    would have been an unrewarding experience. They knew nothing of the
    social organisation of the village beyond knowing which adults were
    heads of families and which adult men and women were married. They used
    the relationship terms loosely and without any real understanding,
    often substituting the term, “sibling of my own sex,” where a sibling
    of opposite sex was meant, and when they applied the term “brother” to
    a young uncle, they did so without the clarity of their elders who,
    while using the term in an age-grouping sense, realised perfectly
    that the “brother” was really a mother’s or father’s brother. In
    their use of language their immaturity was chiefly evidenced by a
    lack of familiarity with the courtesy language, and by much confusion
    in the use of the dual and of the inclusive and exclusive pronouns.
    These present about the same difficulty in their language <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>as the
    use of a nominative after the verb “to be” in English. They had
    also not acquired a mastery of the processes for manipulating the
    vocabulary by the use of very freely combining prefixes and suffixes.
    A child will use the term <i lang="sm">fa’a Samoa</i>, “in Samoan fashion,” or
    <i lang="sm">fa’atama</i>, tomboy, but fail to use the convenient <i lang="sm">fa’a</i> in
    making a new and less stereotyped comparison, using instead some less
    convenient linguistic circumlocution.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

  <p>All of these children had seen birth and death. They had seen many
    dead bodies. They had watched miscarriage and peeked under the arms
    of the old women who were washing and commenting upon the undeveloped
    fœtus. There was no convention of sending children of the family away
    at such times, although the hordes of neighbouring children were
    scattered with a shower of stones if any of the older women could take
    time from the more absorbing events to hurl them. But the feeling here
    was that children were noisy and troublesome; there was no desire to
    protect them from shock or to keep them in ignorance. About half of the
    children had seen a partly developed fœtus, which the Samoans fear will
    otherwise be born as an avenging ghost, cut from a woman’s dead body in
    the open grave. If shock is the result of early experiences with birth,
    death, or sex activities, it should surely be manifest here in this
    postmortem Cæsarian where grief for the dead, fear of death, a sense of
    horror and a dread of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>contamination from contact with the dead, the
    open, unconcealed operation and the sight of the distorted, repulsive
    fœtus all combine to render the experience indelible. An only slightly
    less emotionally charged experience was the often witnessed operation
    of cutting open any dead body to search out the cause of death. These
    operations performed in the shallow open grave, beneath a glaring
    noon-day sun, with a frighted, excited crowd watching in horrified
    fascination, are hardly orderly or unemotional initiations into the
    details of biology and death, and yet they seem to leave no bad effects
    on the children’s emotional make-up. Possibly the adult attitude that
    these are horrible but perfectly natural, non-unique occurrences,
    forming a legitimate part of the child’s experience, may sufficiently
    account for the lack of bad results. Children take an intense interest
    in life and death, and are more proportionately obsessed by it than
    are their adults who divide their horror between the death of a young
    neighbour in child-bed and the fact that the high chief has been
    insulted by some breach of etiquette in the neighbouring village. The
    intricacies of the social life are a closed book to the child and a
    correspondingly fascinating field of exploration in later life, while
    the facts of life and death are shorn of all mystery at an early age.</p>

  <p>In matters of sex the ten-year-olds are equally sophisticated, although
    they witness sex activities only surreptitiously, since all expressions
    of affection are rigorously barred in public. A couple whose wedding
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>night may have been spent in a room with ten other people will
    never the less shrink in shame from even touching hands in public.
    Individuals between whom there have been sex relations are said to be
    “shy of each other,” and manifest this shyness in different fashion but
    with almost the same intensity as in the brother and sister avoidance.
    Husbands and wives never walk side by side through the village, for
    the husband, particularly, would be “ashamed.” So no Samoan child
    is accustomed to seeing father and mother exchange casual caresses.
    The customary salutation by rubbing noses is, of course, as highly
    conventionalised and impersonal as our handshake. The only sort of
    demonstration which ever occurs in public is of the horseplay variety
    between young people whose affections are not really involved. This
    romping is particularly prevalent in groups of women, often taking the
    form of playfully snatching at the sex organs.</p>

  <p>But the lack of privacy within the houses where mosquito netting marks
    off purely formal walls about the married couples, and the custom of
    young lovers of using the palm groves for their rendezvous, makes it
    inevitable that children should see intercourse, often and between many
    different people. In many cases they have not seen first intercourse,
    which is usually accompanied by greater shyness and precaution. With
    the passing of the public ceremony, defloration forms one of the few
    mysteries in a young Samoan’s knowledge of life. But scouring the
    village palm groves in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>search of lovers is one of the recognised forms
    of amusement for the ten-year-olds.</p>

  <p>Samoan children have complete knowledge of the human body and its
    functions, owing to the custom of little children going unclothed, the
    scant clothing of adults, the habit of bathing in the sea, the use of
    the beach as a latrine and the lack of privacy in sexual life. They
    also have a vivid understanding of the nature of sex. Masturbation
    is an all but universal habit, beginning at the age of six or seven.
    There were only three little girls in my group who did not masturbate.
    Theoretically it is discontinued with the beginning of heterosexual
    activity and only resumed again in periods of enforced continence.
    Among grown boys and girls casual homosexual practices also supplant
    it to a certain extent. Boys masturbate in groups but among little
    girls it is a more individualistic, secretive practice. This habit
    seems never to be a matter of individual discovery, one child always
    learning from another. The adult ban only covers the unseemliness of
    open indulgence.</p>

  <p>The adult attitude towards all the details of sex is characterised by
    this view that they are unseemly, not that they are wrong. Thus a youth
    would think nothing of shouting the length of the village, “Ho, maiden,
    wait for me in your bed to-night,” but public comment upon the details
    of sex or of evacuation were considered to be in bad taste. All the
    words which are thus banished from polite conversation are cherished
    by the children who roll the salacious morsels under their <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>tongues
    with great relish. The children of seven and eight get as much illicit
    satisfaction out of the other functions of the body as out of sex. This
    is interesting in view of the different attitude in Samoa towards the
    normal processes of evacuation. There is no privacy and no sense of
    shame. Nevertheless the brand of bad taste seems to be as effective in
    interesting the young children as is the brand of indecency among us.
    It is also curious that in theory and in fact boys and men take a more
    active interest in the salacious than do the women and girls.</p>

  <p>It seems difficult to account for a salacious attitude among a people
    where so little is mysterious, so little forbidden. The precepts of the
    missionaries may have modified the native attitude more than the native
    practice. And the adult attitude towards children as non-participants
    may also be an important causal factor. For this seems to be the
    more correct view of any prohibitions which govern children. There
    is little evidence of a desire to preserve a child’s innocence or to
    protect it from witnessing behaviour, the following of which would
    constitute the heinous offence, <i lang="sm">tautala laititi</i> (“presuming
    above one’s age”). For while a pair of lovers would never indulge in
    any demonstration before any one, child or adult, who was merely a
    spectator, three or four pairs of lovers who are relatives or friends
    often choose a common rendezvous. (This, of course, excludes relatives
    of opposite sex, included in the brother and sister avoidance, although
    married <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>brothers and sisters might live in the same house after
    marriage.) From the night dances, now discontinued under missionary
    influence, which usually ended in a riot of open promiscuity, children
    and old people were excluded, as non-participants whose presence as
    uninvolved spectators would have been indecent. This attitude towards
    non-participants characterised all emotionally charged events, a
    women’s weaving bee which was of a formal, ceremonial nature, a
    house-building, a candle-nut burning—these were activities at which the
    presence of a spectator would have been unseemly.</p>

  <p>Yet, coupled with the sophistication of the children went no
    pre-adolescent heterosexual experimentation and very little
    homosexual activity which was regarded in native theory as imitative
    of and substitutive for heterosexual. The lack of precocious sex
    experimentation is probably due less to the parental ban on such
    precocity than to the strong institutionalised antagonism between
    younger boys and younger girls and the taboo against any amiable
    intercourse between them. This rigid sex dichotomy may also be
    operative in determining the lack of specialisation of sex feeling in
    adults. Since there is a heavily charged avoidance feeling towards
    brother and cousins, and a tendency to lump all other males together
    as the enemy who will some day be one’s lovers, there are no males in
    a girl’s age group whom she ever regards simply as individuals without
    relation to sex.</p>

  <p>Such then was the experience of the twenty-eight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>little girls in the
    three villages. In temperament and character they varied enormously.
    There was Tita, who at nine acted like a child of seven, was still
    principally preoccupied with food, completely irresponsible as to
    messages and commissions, satisfied to point a proud fat finger at
    her father who was town crier. Only a year her senior was Pele,
    the precocious little sister of the loosest woman in the village.
    Pele spent most of her time caring for her sister’s baby which, she
    delighted in telling you, was of disputed parentage. Her dancing
    in imitation of her sister’s was daring and obscene. Yet, despite
    the burden of the heavy ailing baby which she carried always on her
    hip and the sordidness of her home where her fifty-year-old mother
    still took occasional lovers and her weak-kneed insignificant father
    lived a hen-pecked ignominious existence, Pele’s attitude towards
    life was essentially gay and sane. Better than suggestive dancing
    she liked hunting for rare <i lang="sm">samoana</i> shells along the beach or
    diving feet first into the swimming hole or hunting for land crabs in
    the moonlight. Fortunately for her, she lived in the centre of the
    Lumā gang. In a more isolated spot her unwholesome home and natural
    precocity might have developed very differently. As it was, she
    differed far less from the other children in her group than her family,
    the most notorious in the village, differed from the families of her
    companions. In a Samoan village the influence of the home environment
    is being continually offset in the next generation by <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>group activities
    through which the normal group standards assert themselves. This was
    universally true for the boys for whom the many years’ apprenticeship
    in the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> formed an excellent school for disciplining
    individual peculiarities. In the case of the girls this function was
    formerly performed in part by the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i>, but, as I pointed out
    in the chapter on the girl and her age group, the little girl is much
    more dependent upon her neighbourhood than is the boy. As an adult she
    is also more dependent upon her relationship group.</p>

  <p>Tuna, who lived next door to Pele, was in a different plight, the
    unwilling little victim of the great Samoan sin of <i lang="sm">tautala
    laititi</i>. Her sister Lila had eloped at fifteen with a
    seventeen-year-old boy. A pair of hot-headed children, they had never
    thoroughly re-established themselves with the community, although their
    families had relented and solemnised the marriage with an appropriate
    exchange of property. Lila still smarted under the public disapproval
    of her precocity and lavished a disproportionate amount of affection
    upon her obstreperous baby whose incessant crying was the bane of the
    neighbourhood. After spoiling him beyond endurance, she would hand him
    over to Tuna. Tuna, a stocky little creature with a large head and
    enormous melting eyes, looked at life from a slightly oblique angle.
    She was a little more calculating than the other children, a little
    more watchful for returns, less given to gratuitous outlays of personal
    service. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>Her sister’s overindulgence of the baby made Tuna’s task much
    harder than those of her companions. But she reaped her reward in the
    slightly extra gentleness with which they treated their most burdened
    associate, and here again the group saved her from a pronounced
    temperamental response to the exigencies of her home life.</p>

  <p>A little further away lived Fitu and Ula, Maliu and Pola, two pairs
    of sisters. Fitu and Maliu, girls of about thirteen, were just
    withdrawing from the gang, turning their younger brothers and sisters
    over to Ula and Pola, and beginning to take a more active part in the
    affairs of their households. Ula was alert, pretty, pampered. Her
    household might in all fairness be compared to ours; it consisted of
    her mother, her father, two sisters and two brothers. True, her uncle
    who lived next door was the <i lang="sm">matai</i> of the household, but still
    this little biological family had a strong separate existence of its
    own and the children showed the results of it. Lalala, the mother,
    was an intelligent and still beautiful woman, even after bearing six
    children in close succession. She came from a family of high rank,
    and because she had had no brothers, her father had taught her much
    of the genealogical material usually taught to the favourite son. Her
    knowledge of the social structure of the community and of the minutiæ
    of the ceremonies which had formerly surrounded the court of the king
    of Manu’a was as full as that of any middle-aged man in the community.
    She was skilled in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>handicrafts and her brain was full of new
    designs and unusual applications of material. She knew several potent
    medical remedies and had many patients. Married at fifteen, while still
    a virgin, her marital life, which had begun with the cruel public
    defloration ceremony, had been her only sex experience. She adored
    her husband, whose poverty was due to his having come from another
    island and not to laziness or inability. Lalala made her choices in
    life with a full recognition of the facts of her existence. There was
    too much for her to do. She had no younger sisters to bear the brunt
    of baby-tending for her. There were no youths to help her husband
    in the plantations. Well and good, she would not wrestle with the
    inevitable. And so Lalala’s house was badly kept. Her children were
    dirty and bedraggled. But her easy good nature did not fail her as she
    tried to weave a fine mat on some blazing afternoon, while the baby
    played with the brittle easily broken pandanus strands, and doubled her
    work. But all of this reacted upon Fitu, lanky, ill-favoured executive
    little creature that she was. Fitu combined a passionate devotion to
    her mother with an obsessive solicitude for her younger brothers and
    sisters. Towards Ula alone her attitude was mixed. Ula, fifteen months
    younger, was pretty, lithe, flexible and indolent. While Fitu was often
    teased by her mother and rebuked by her companions for being like a
    boy, Ula was excessively feminine. She worked as hard as any other
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>child of her age, but Fitu felt that their mother and their home were
    unusual and demanded more than the average service and devotion. She
    and her mother were like a pair of comrades, and Fitu bossed and joked
    with her mother in a fashion shocking to all Samoan onlookers. If Fitu
    was away at night, her mother went herself to look for her, instead of
    sending another child. Fitu was the eldest daughter, with a precocity
    bred of responsibility and an efficiency which was the direct outcome
    of her mother’s laissez-faire attitude. Ula showed equally clearly the
    effect of being the prettier younger sister, trading upon her superior
    attractiveness and more meagre sense of duty. These children, as did
    the children in all three of the biological families in the three
    villages, showed more character, more sharply defined personality,
    greater precocity and a more personal, more highly charged attitude
    towards their parents.</p>

  <p>It would be easy to lay too much stress on the differences between
    children in large households and children in small ones. There were,
    of course, too few cases to draw any final conclusions. But the small
    family in Samoa <em>did</em> demand from the child the very qualities
    which were frowned upon in Samoan society, based upon the ideal of
    great households in which there were many youthful labourers who knew
    their place. And in these small families where responsibility and
    initiative were necessary, the children seemed to develop <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>them much
    earlier than in the more usual home environment in which any display of
    such qualities was sternly frowned upon.</p>

  <p>This was the case with Malui and Meta, Ipu and Vi, Mata, Tino and
    Lama, little girls just approaching puberty who lived in large
    heterogeneous households. They were giving over baby-tending for more
    productive work. They were reluctantly acquiring some of the rudiments
    of etiquette; they were slowly breaking their play affiliations with
    the younger children. But all of this was an enforced change of habits
    rather than any change in attitude. They were conscious of their new
    position as almost grown girls who could be trusted to go fishing or
    work on the plantations. Under their short dresses they again wore
    <i lang="sm">lavalavas</i> which they had almost forgotten how to keep fastened.
    These dragged about their legs and cramped their movements and fell
    off if they broke into a sprint. Most of all they missed the gang life
    and eyed a little wistfully the activities of their younger relatives.
    Their large impersonal households provided them with no personal
    drives, invested them with no intriguing responsibilities. They were
    simply little girls who were robust enough to do heavy work and old
    enough to learn to do skilled work, and so had less time for play.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

  <p>In general attitude, they differed not at all from Tolo, from Tulipa,
    from Lua, or Lata, whose first menstruation was a few months past. No
    ceremony had marked the difference between the two groups. No social
    attitude testified to a crisis past. They were told not to make kava
    while menstruating, but the participation in a restriction they’d
    known about all their lives was unimpressive. Some of them had made
    kava before puberty, others had not. It depended entirely upon whether
    there was an available girl or boy about when a chief wished to have
    some kava made. In more rigorous days a girl could not make kava nor
    marry until she menstruated. But the former restriction had yielded
    to the requirements of expediency. The menstruating girl experienced
    very little pain which might have served to stress for her her new
    maturity. All of the girls reported back or abdominal pains which,
    however, were so slight that they seldom interfered in any way with
    their usual activities. In the table I have counted it unusual pain
    whenever a girl was incapacitated for work, but these cases were
    in no sense comparable to severe cases of menstrual cramps in our
    civilisation. They were unaccompanied by dizziness, fainting spells,
    or pain sufficient to call forth groaning or writhing. The idea of
    such pain struck all Samoan women as bizarre and humorous when it was
    described to them. And no special solicitude for her health, mental
    or physical, was shown to the menstruating girl. From foreign medical
    advice they had learned that bathing during menstruation was bad, and
    a mother occasionally cautioned her daughter not to bathe. There was
    no sense of shame connected with puberty nor any need of concealment.
    Pre-adolescent children took the news that a girl had reached puberty,
    a woman had had a baby, a boat had come from Ofu, or a pig had been
    killed by a falling boulder with the same insouciance—all bits of
    diverting gossip; and any girl could give accurate testimony as to the
    development of any other girl in her neighbourhood or relationship
    groups. Nor was puberty the immediate forerunner of sex experience.
    Perhaps a year, two or even three years would pass before a girl’s
    shyness would relax, or her figure appeal to the roving eye of some
    older boy. To be a virgin’s first lover was considered the high point
    of pleasure and amorous virtuosity, so that a girl’s first lover was
    usually not a boy of her own age, equally shy and inexperienced. The
    girls in this group were divided into little girls like Lua, and gawky
    overgrown Tolo, who said frankly that they did not want to go walking
    with boys, and girls like Pala, who while still virgins, were a little
    weary of their status and eager for amorous experience. That they
    remained in this passive untouched state so long was mainly due to the
    conventions of love-making, for while a youth liked to woo a virgin,
    he feared ridicule as a cradle-snatcher, while the girls also feared
    the dreaded accusation of <i lang="sm">tautala laititi</i> (“presuming above
    one’s age”). The forays of more seasoned middle-aged marauders among
    these very young girls were frowned upon, and so the adolescent girls
    were given a valuable interval in which to get accustomed to new work,
    greater isolation and an unfamiliar physical development. The next
    older girls were definitely divided as to whether or not they lived in
    the pastor’s households. A glance at the table in the appendix will
    show that among the girls a couple of years past puberty, there is a
    definite inverse correlation between residence at home and chastity,
    with only one exception, Ela, who had been forgiven and taken back into
    the household of a pastor where workers were short. Ela’s best friend
    was her cousin, Talo, the only girl in the group who had sex experience
    before menstruation had begun. But Talo was clearly a case of delayed
    menstruation; all the other signs of puberty were present. Her aunt
    shrugged her shoulders in the face of Talo’s obvious sophistication
    and winning charm and made no attempt to control her. The friendship
    between these two girls was one of the really important friendships in
    the whole group. Both girls definitely proclaimed their preference, and
    their homosexual practices were undoubtedly instrumental in producing
    Talo’s precocity and solacing Ela for the stricter régime of the
    pastor’s household.</p>

  <p>These casual homosexual relations between girls never assumed any
    long-time importance. On the part of growing girls or women who
    were working together they were regarded as a pleasant and natural
    diversion, just tinged with the salacious. Where heterosexual
    relationships were so casual, so shallowly channelled, there was
    no pattern into which homosexual relationships could fall. Native
    theory and vocabulary recognised <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>the real pervert who was incapable
    of normal heterosexual response, and the very small population is
    probably sufficient explanation for the rarity of these types. I saw
    only one, Sasi, a boy of twenty who was studying for the ministry.
    He was slightly but not pronouncedly feminine in appearance, was
    skilled at women’s work and his homosexual drive was strong enough to
    goad him into making continual advances to other boys. He spent more
    time casually in the company of girls, maintained a more easy-going
    friendship with them than any other boy on the island. Sasi had
    proposed marriage to a girl in a pastor’s household in a distant
    village and been refused, but as there was a rule that divinity
    students must marry before ordination, this has little significance. I
    could find no evidence that he had ever had heterosexual relations and
    the girls’ casual attitude towards him was significant. They regarded
    him as an amusing freak while the men to whom he had made advances
    looked upon him with mingled annoyance and contempt. There were no
    girls who presented such a clear picture although three of the deviants
    discussed in the next chapter were clearly mixed types, without,
    however, showing convincing evidence of genuine perversion.</p>

  <p>The general preoccupation with sex, the attitude that minor sex
    activities, suggestive dancing, stimulating salacious conversation,
    salacious songs and definitely motivated tussling are all acceptable
    and attractive diversions, is mainly responsible for the native
    attitude <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>towards homosexual practices. They are simply <em>play</em>,
    neither frowned upon nor given much consideration. As heterosexual
    relations are given significance not by love and a tremendous fixation
    upon one individual, the only forces which can make a homosexual
    relationship lasting and important, but by children and the place of
    marriage in the economic and social structure of the village, it is
    easy to understand why very prevalent homosexual practices have no more
    important or striking results. The recognition and use in heterosexual
    relations of all the secondary variations of sex activity which loom
    as primary in homosexual relations are instrumental also in minimising
    their importance. The effects of chance childhood perversions, the
    fixation of attention on unusual erogenous zones with consequent
    transfer of sensitivity from the more normal centres, the absence of
    a definite and accomplished specialisation of erogenous zones—all the
    accidents of emotional development which in a civilisation, recognising
    only one narrow form of sex activity, result in unsatisfactory
    marriages, casual homosexuality and prostitution, are here rendered
    harmless. The Samoan puts the burden of amatory success upon the
    man and believes that women need more initiating, more time for the
    maturing of sex feeling. A man who fails to satisfy a woman is looked
    upon as a clumsy, inept blunderer, a fit object for village ridicule
    and contempt. The women in turn are conscious that their lovers use a
    definite technique which they regard with a sort of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>fatalism as if
    all men had a set of slightly magical, wholly irresistible, tricks
    up their sleeves. But amatory lore is passed down from one man to
    another and is looked upon much more self-consciously and analytically
    by men than by women. Parents are shy of going beyond the bounds
    of casual conversation (naturally these are much wider than in our
    civilisation) in the discussion of sex with their children, so that
    definite instruction passes from the man of twenty-five to the boy of
    eighteen rather than from father to son. The girls learn from the boys
    and do very little confiding in each other. All of a man’s associates
    will know every detail of some unusual sex experience while the girl
    involved will hardly have confided the bare outlines to any one. Her
    lack of any confidants except relatives towards whom there is always a
    slight barrier of reserve (I have seen a girl shudder away from acting
    as an ambassador to her sister) may partly account for this.</p>

  <p>The fact that educating one sex in detail and merely fortifying
    the other sex with enough knowledge and familiarity with sex to
    prevent shock produces normal sex adjustments is due to the free
    experimentation which is permitted and the rarity with which both
    lovers are amateurs. I knew of only one such case, where two children,
    a sixteen-year-old boy and a fifteen-year-old girl, both in boarding
    schools on another island, ran away together. Through inexperience
    they bungled badly. They were both expelled <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>from school, and the boy
    is now a man of twenty-four with high intelligence and real charm, but
    a notorious <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, execrated by every girl in his village.
    Familiarity with sex, and the recognition of a need of a technique to
    deal with sex as an art, have produced a scheme of personal relations
    in which there are no neurotic pictures, no frigidity, no impotence,
    except as the temporary result of severe illness, and the capacity for
    intercourse only once in a night is counted as senility.</p>

  <p>Of the twenty-five girls past puberty, eleven had had heterosexual
    experience. Fala, Tolu, and Namu were three cousins who were popular
    with the youths of their own village and also with visitors from
    distant Fitiuta. The women of Fala’s family were of easy virtue; Tolu’s
    father was dead and she lived with her blind mother in the home of
    Namu’s parents, who, burdened with six children under twelve years
    of age, were not going to risk losing two efficient workers by too
    close supervision. The three girls made common rendezvous with their
    lovers and their liaisons were frequent and gay. Tolu, the eldest, was
    a little weary after three years of casual adventures and professed
    herself willing to marry. She later moved into the household of an
    important chief in order to improve her chances of meeting strange
    youths who might be interested in matrimony. Namu was genuinely taken
    with a boy from Fitiuta whom she met in secret while a boy of her
    own village whom her parents favoured courted her openly. Occasional
    assignations with other <span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>boys of her own village relieved the monotony
    of life between visits from her preferred lover. Fala, the youngest,
    was content to let matters drift. Her lovers were friends and relatives
    of the lovers of her cousins and she was still sufficiently childlike
    and uninvolved to get almost as much enjoyment out of her cousins’
    love affairs as out of her own. All three of these girls worked hard,
    doing the full quota of work for an adult. All day they fished, washed,
    worked on the plantation, wove mats and blinds. Tolu was exceptionally
    clever at weaving. They were valuable economic assets to their
    families; they would be valuable to the husbands whom their families
    were not over anxious to find for them.</p>

  <p>In the next village lived Luna, a lazy good-natured girl, three years
    past puberty. Her mother was dead. Her father had married again, but
    the second wife had gone back to her own people. Luna lived for several
    years in the pastor’s household and had gone home when her stepmother
    left her father. Her father was a very old chief, tremendously
    preoccupied with his prestige and reputation in the village. He held
    an important title; he was a master craftsman; he was the best versed
    man in the village in ancient lore and details of ceremonial procedure.
    His daughter was a devoted and efficient attendant. It was enough.
    Luna tired of the younger girls who had been her companions in the
    pastor’s household and sought instead two young married women among her
    relatives. One of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>these, a girl who had deserted her husband and was
    living with a temporary successor came to live in Luna’s household.
    She and Luna were constant companions, and Luna, quite easily and
    inevitably took one lover, then two, then a third—all casual affairs.
    She dressed younger than her years, emphasised that she was still
    a girl. Some day she would marry and be a church member, but now:
    <i lang="sm">Laititi a’u</i> (“I am but young”). And who was she to give up
    dancing.</p>

  <p>Her cousin Lotu was a church member, and had attended the missionary
    boarding school. She had had only one accepted lover, the illegitimate
    son of a chief who dared not jeopardise his very slender chance of
    succeeding to his father’s title by marrying her. She was the eldest
    of nine children, living in the third strictly biological family in
    the village. She showed the effects of greater responsibility at home
    by a quiet maturity and decision of manner, of her school training
    in a greater neatness of person and regard for the nicety of detail.
    Although she was transgressing, the older church members charitably
    closed their eyes, sympathising with her lover’s family dilemma. Her
    only other sex experience had been with a <i lang="sm">moetotolo</i>, a relative.
    Should her long fidelity to her lover lead to pregnancy, she would
    probably bear the child. (When a Samoan woman does wish to avoid
    giving birth to a child, exceedingly violent massage and the chewing
    of kava is resorted to, but this is only in very exceptional cases,
    as even illegitimate children are enthusiastically <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>welcomed.) Lotu’s
    attitudes were more considered, more sophisticated than those of the
    other girls of her age. Had it not been for the precarious social
    status of her lover, she would probably have been married already. As
    it was, she laboured over the care of her younger brothers and sisters,
    and followed the routine of relationship duties incumbent upon a young
    girl in the largest family on the island. She reconciled her church
    membership and her deviation from chastity by the tranquil reflection
    that she would have married had it been possible, and her sin rested
    lightly upon her.</p>

  <p>In the household of one high chief lived the Samoan version of our
    devoted maiden aunts. She was docile, efficient, responsible, entirely
    overshadowed by several more attractive girls. To her were entrusted
    the new-born babies and the most difficult diplomatic errands. Hard
    work which she never resented took up all her time and energy. When she
    was asked to dance, she did so negligently. Others dancing so much more
    brilliantly, why make the effort? Hers was the appreciative worshipping
    disposition which glowed over Tolu’s beauty or Fala’s conquests or
    Alofi’s new baby. She played the ukulele for others to dance, sewed
    flower necklaces for others to wear, planned rendezvous for others to
    enjoy, without humiliation or a special air of martyrdom. She admitted
    that she had had but one lover. He had come from far away; she didn’t
    even know from what village, and he had never come back. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>Yes, probably
    she would marry some day if her chief so willed it, and was that the
    baby crying? She was the stuff of whom devoted aunts are made, depended
    upon and loved by all about her. A <i lang="sm">malaga</i> to another village
    might have changed her life, for Samoa boys sought strange girls merely
    because they were strangers. But she was always needed at home by some
    one and younger girls went journeying in her stead.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the most dramatic story was that of Moana, the last of the
    group of girls who lived outside the pastors’ households, a vain,
    sophisticated child, spoiled by years of trading upon her older
    half-sister’s devotion. Her amours had begun at fifteen and by the time
    a year and a half had passed, her parents, fearing that her conduct
    was becoming so indiscreet as to seriously mar her chances of making
    a good marriage, asked her uncle to adopt her and attempt to curb her
    waywardness. This uncle, who was a widower and a sophisticated rake,
    when he realised the extent of his niece’s experience, availed himself
    also of her complacency. This incident, not common in Samoa, because of
    the great lack of privacy and isolation, would have passed undetected
    in this case, if Moana’s older sister, Sila, had not been in love with
    the uncle also. This was the only example of prolonged and intense
    passion which I found in the three villages. Samoans rate romantic
    fidelity in terms of days or weeks at most, and are inclined to scoff
    at tales of life-long devotion. (They greeted the story of Romeo and
    Juliet with incredulous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>contempt.) But Sila was devoted to Mutu, her
    stepfather’s younger brother, to the point of frenzy. She had been his
    mistress and still lived in his household, but his dilettantism had
    veered away from her indecorous intensity. When she discovered that
    he had lived with her sister, her fury knew no bounds. Masked under a
    deep solicitude for the younger girl, whom she claimed was an innocent
    untouched child, she denounced Mutu the length of the three villages.
    Moana’s parents fetched her home again in a great rage and a family
    feud resulted. Village feeling ran high, but opinion was divided as to
    whether Mutu was guilty, Moana lying to cover some other peccadillo or
    Sila gossiping from spite. The incident was in direct violation of the
    brother and sister taboo for Mutu was young enough for Moana to speak
    of him as <i lang="sm">tuagane</i> (brother). But when two months later, another
    older sister died during pregnancy, it was necessary to find some one
    stout-hearted enough to perform the necessary Cæsarian post-mortem
    operation. After a violent family debate, expediency triumphed and
    Mutu, most skilled of native surgeons, was summoned to operate on the
    dead body of the sister of the girl he had violated. When he later on
    announced his intention of marrying a girl from another island, Sila
    again displayed the most uncontrolled grief and despair, although she
    herself was carrying on a love affair at the time.</p>

  <p>The lives of the girls who lived in the pastor’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>household differed
    from those of their less restricted sisters and cousins only in the
    fact that they had no love affairs and lived a more regular and ordered
    existence. For the excitement of moonlight trysts they substituted
    group activities, letting the pleasant friendliness of a group of
    girls fill their lesser leisure. Their interest in salacious material
    was slightly stronger than the interest of the girls who were free to
    experiment. They made real friends outside their relationship group,
    trusted other girls more, worked better in a group, were more at
    ease with one another but less conscious of their place in their own
    households than were the others.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the few cases to be discussed in the next
    chapter, adolescence represented no period of crisis or stress, but was
    instead an orderly developing of a set of slowly maturing interests and
    activities. The girls’ minds were perplexed by no conflicts, troubled
    by no philosophical queries, beset by no remote ambitions. To live as
    a girl with many lovers as long as possible and then to marry in one’s
    own village, near one’s own relatives and to have many children, these
    were uniform and satisfying ambitions.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">THE GIRL IN CONFLICT</div>

  <p>Were there no conflicts, no temperaments which deviated so markedly
    from the normal that clash was inevitable? Was the diffused affection
    and the diffused authority of the large families, the ease of moving
    from one family to another, the knowledge of sex and the freedom to
    experiment a sufficient guarantee to all Samoan girls of a perfect
    adjustment? In almost all cases, yes. But I have reserved for this
    chapter the tales of the few girls who deviated in temperament or in
    conduct, although in many cases these deviations were only charged with
    possibilities of conflict, and actually had no painful results.</p>

  <p>The girl between fourteen and twenty stands at the centre of household
    pressure and can expend her irritation at her elders on those over
    whom she is in a position of authority. The possibility of escape
    seems to temper her restiveness under authority and the irritation
    of her elders also. When to the fear of a useful worker’s running
    away is added also the fear of a daughter’s indulging in a public
    elopement, and thus lowering her marriage value, any marked exercise
    of parental authority is considerably mitigated. Violent outbursts of
    wrath and summary chastisements do occur <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>but consistent and prolonged
    disciplinary measures are absent, and a display of temper is likely to
    be speedily followed by conciliatory measures. This, of course, applies
    only to the relation between a girl and her elders. Often conflicts of
    personality between young people of the same age in a household are
    not so tempered, but the removal of one party to the conflict, the
    individual with the weakest claims upon the household, is here also
    the most frequent solution. The fact that the age-group gang breaks
    up before adolescence and is never resumed except in a highly formal
    manner, coupled with the decided preference for household rather than
    group solidarity, accounts for the scarcity of conflict here. The child
    who shuns her age mates is more available for household work and is
    never worried by questions as to why she doesn’t run and play with the
    other children. On the other hand, the tolerance of the children in
    accepting physical defect or slight strangeness of temperament prevents
    any child’s suffering from undeserved ostracism.</p>

  <p>The child who is unfavourably located in the village is the only real
    exile. Should the age group last over eight or ten years of age, the
    exiles would certainly suffer or very possibly as they grew bolder,
    venture farther from home. But the breakdown of the gang just as the
    children are bold enough and free enough to go ten houses from home,
    prevents either of these two results from occurring.</p>

  <p>The absence of any important institutionalised relationship <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>to the
    community is perhaps the strongest cause for lack of conflict here.
    The community makes no demands upon the young girls except for the
    occasional ceremonial service rendered at the meetings of older women.
    Were they delinquent in such duties it would be primarily the concern
    of their own households whose prestige would suffer thereby. A boy who
    refuses to attend the meetings of the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, or to join in the
    communal work, comes in for strong group disapproval and hostility, but
    a girl owes so small a debt to her community that it does not greatly
    concern itself to collect it.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to experiment freely, the complete familiarity with sex
    and the absence of very violent preferences make her sex experiences
    less charged with possibilities of conflict than they are in a more
    rigid and self-conscious civilisation. Cases of passionate jealousy do
    occur but they are matters for extended comment and amazement. During
    nine months in the islands only four cases came to my attention, a girl
    who informed against a faithless lover accusing him of incest, a girl
    who bit off part of a rival’s ear, a woman whose husband had deserted
    her and who fought and severely injured her successor, and a girl who
    falsely accused a rival of stealing. But jealousy is less expected and
    less sympathised with than among us, and consequently there is less
    of a pattern to which an individual may respond. Possibly conditions
    may also be simplified by the Samoan recognition and toleration
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>of vindictive detraction and growling about a rival. There are no
    standards of good form which prescribe an insincere acceptance of
    defeat, no insistence on reticence and sportsmanship. So a great deal
    of slight irritation can be immediately dissipated. Friendships are of
    so casual and shifting a nature that they give rise to neither jealousy
    nor conflict. Resentment is expressed by subdued grumblings and any
    strong resentment results in the angry one’s leaving the household or
    sometimes the village.</p>

  </figure>

  <p>In the girl’s religious life the attitude of the missionaries was
    the decisive one. The missionaries require chastity for church
    membership and discouraged church membership before marriage, except
    for the young people in the missionary boarding schools who could
    be continually supervised. This passive acceptance by the religious
    authorities themselves of pre-marital irregularities went a long way
    towards minimising the girls’ sense of guilt. Continence became not
    a passport to heaven but a passport to the missionary schools which
    in turn were regarded as a social rather than a religious adventure.
    The girl who indulged in sex experiments was expelled from the local
    pastor’s school, but it was notable that almost every older girl in
    the community, including the most notorious sex offenders, had been
    at one time resident in the pastors’ households. The general result
    of the stricter supervision provided by these schools seemed to be to
    postpone the first sex experience two or three years. The seven girls
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>in the household of one native pastor, the three in the household of
    the other, were all, although past puberty, living continent lives, in
    strong contrast to the habits of the rest of their age mates.</p>

  <p>It might seem that there was fertile material for conflict between
    parents who wished their children to live in the pastor’s house and
    children who did not wish to do so, and also between children who
    wished it and parents who did not.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This conflict was chiefly reduced
    by the fact that residence in the pastor’s house actually made very
    little difference in the child’s status in her own home. She simply
    carried her roll of mats, her pillow and her mosquito net from her
    home to the pastor’s, and the food which she would have eaten at home
    was added to the quota of the food which her family furnished to the
    pastor. She ate her evening meal and slept at the pastor’s; one or two
    days a week she devoted to working for the pastor’s family, washing,
    weaving, weeding and sweeping the premises. The rest of her time she
    spent at home performing the usual tasks of a girl of her age, so that
    it was seldom that a parent objected strongly to sending a child to the
    pastor’s. It involved no additional expense and was likely to reduce
    the chances of his daughter’s conduct becoming embarrassing, to improve
    her mastery of the few foreign techniques, sewing, ironing, embroidery,
    which she could learn from the more skilled and schooled pastor’s wife
    and thus increase her economic value.</p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">[8]</a> See Appendix, <a href="#Page_257">page 257</a>.
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, the
  parents wished their children to stay and the children were unwilling
  to do so, the remedy was simple. They had but to transgress seriously
  the rules of the pastor’s household, and they would be expelled;
  if they feared to return to their parents, there were always other
  relatives.</p>

  <p>So the attitude of the church in respect to chastity held only
    the germs of a conflict which was seldom realised, because of the
    flexibility with which it adapted itself to the nearly inevitable.
    Attendance at the girls’ main boarding school was an attractive
    prospect. The fascination of living in a large group of young people
    where life was easier and more congenial than at home, was usually
    a sufficient bribe to good behaviour, or at least to discretion.
    Confession of sin was a rare phenomenon in Samoa. The missionaries had
    made a rule that a boy who transgressed the chastity rule would be
    held back in his progress through the preparatory school and seminary
    for two years after the time his offence was committed. It had been
    necessary to change this ruling to read <em>two years from the detection
    of the offence</em>, because very often the offence was not detected
    until after the student had been over two years in the seminary, and
    under the old ruling, he would not have been punished at all. Had the
    young people been inspired with a sense of responsibility to a heavenly
    rather than an earthly decree and the boy or girl been answerable to a
    recording angel, rather than a spying neighbour, religion would have
    provided a real <span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>setting for conflict. If such an attitude had been
    coupled with emphasis upon church membership for the young and an
    expectation of religious experience in the lives of the young, crises
    in the lives of the young people would very likely have occurred. As
    it is, the whole religious setting is one of formalism, of compromise,
    of acceptance of half measure. The great number of native pastors with
    their peculiar interpretations of Christian teaching have made it
    impossible to establish the rigour of western Protestantism with its
    inseparable association of sex offences and an individual consciousness
    of sin. And the girls upon whom the religious setting makes no demands,
    make no demands upon it. They are content to follow the advice of their
    elders to defer church membership until they are older. <i lang="sm">Laititi
    a’u. Fia siva</i> (“For I am young and like to dance”). The church
    member is forbidden to dance or to witness a large night dance. One of
    the three villages boasted no girl church members. The second village
    had only one, who had, however, long since transgressed her vows. But
    as her lover was a youth whose equivocal position in his family made
    it impossible to marry, the neighbours did not tattle where their
    sympathies were aroused, so Lotu remained tacitly a church member.
    In the third village there were two unmarried girls who were church
    members, Lita and Ana.</p>

  <p>Lita had lived for years in the pastor’s household and with one other
    girl, showed most clearly the results of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>a slightly alien environment.
    She was clever and executive, preferred the society of girls to that of
    boys, had made the best of her opportunities to learn English, worked
    hard at school, and wished to go to Tutuila and become a nurse or a
    teacher. Her ideals were thus just such as might frequently be found
    from any random selection of girls in a freshman class in a girls’
    college in this country. She coupled this set of individual ambitions
    with a very unusual enthusiasm for a pious father, and complied easily
    with his expressed wish for her to become a church member. After she
    left the pastor’s household, she continued to go to school and apply
    herself vigorously to her studies, and her one other interest in life
    was a friendship with an older cousin who spoke some English and had
    had superior educational advantages in another island. Although this
    friendship had most of the trappings of a “crush” and was accompanied
    by the casual homosexual practices which are the usual manifestations
    of most associations between young people of the same sex, Lita’s
    motivation was more definitely ambition, a desire to master every
    accessible detail of this alien culture in which she wished to find a
    place.</p>

  <p>Sona, who was two years younger than Lita and had also lived for
    several years in the pastor’s household, presented a very similar
    picture. She was overbearing in manner, arbitrary and tyrannous towards
    younger people, impudently deferential towards her elders. Without
    exceptional intellectual capacity she had exceptional <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>persistence
    and had forced her way to the head of the school by steady dogged
    application. Lita, more intelligent and more sensitive, had left
    school for one year because the teacher beat her and Sona had passed
    above her, although she was definitely more stupid. Sona came from
    another island. Both her parents were dead and she lived in a large,
    heterogeneous household, at the beck and call of a whole series of
    relatives. Intent on her own ends, she was not enthusiastic about all
    this labour and was also unenthusiastic about most of her relatives.
    But one older cousin, the most beautiful girl in the village, had
    caught her imagination. This cousin, Manita, was twenty-seven and
    still unmarried. She had had many suitors and nearly as many lovers
    but she was of a haughty and aggressive nature and men whom she deemed
    worthy of her hand were wary of her sophisticated domineering manner.
    By unanimous vote she was the most beautiful girl in the village.
    Her lovely golden hair had contributed to half a dozen ceremonial
    headdresses. Her strategic position in her own family was heightened
    by the fact that her uncle, who had no hereditary right to make a
    <i lang="sm">taupo</i>, had declared Manita to be his <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. There was no
    other <i lang="sm">taupo</i> in the village to dispute her claim. The murmurings
    were dying out; the younger children spoke of her as a <i lang="sm">taupo</i>
    without suspicion; her beauty and ability as a dancer made it expedient
    to thus introduce her to visitors. Her family did not press her to
    marry, for the longer she remained unmarried, the stronger waxed the
    upstart legend. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>Her last lover had been a widower, a talking chief of
    intelligence and charm. He had loved Manita but he would not marry her.
    She lacked the docility which he demanded in a wife. Leaving Manita he
    searched in other villages for some very young girl whose manners were
    good but whose character was as yet unformed.</p>

  <p>All this had a profound effect upon Sona, the ugly little stranger over
    whose lustreless eyes cataracts were already beginning to form. “Her
    sister” has no use for marriage; neither had she, Sona. Essentially
    unfeminine in outlook, dominated by ambition, she bolstered up her
    preference for the society of girls and a career by citing the example
    of her beautiful, wilful cousin. Without such a sanction she might have
    wavered in her ambitions, made so difficult by her already failing
    eyesight. As it was she went forward, blatantly proclaiming her pursuit
    of ends different from those approved by her fellows. Sona and Lita
    were not friends; the difference in their sanctions was too great;
    their proficiency at school and an intense rivalry divided them.
    Sona was not a church member. It would not have interfered with her
    behaviour in the least but it was part of her scheme of life to remain
    a school girl as long as possible and thus fend off responsibilities.
    So she, as often as the others, would answer, <i lang="sm">Laititi a’u</i> (“I am
    but young”). While Lita attached herself to her cousin and attempted to
    learn from her every detail of another life, Sona identified herself
    passionately with the slightly more Europeanised family of the pastor,
    asserting <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>always their greater relationship to the new civilisation,
    calling Ioane’s wife, Mrs. Johns, building up a pitiable platform
    of <i lang="sm">papalagi</i> (foreign) mannerisms as a springboard for future
    activities.</p>

  <p>There was one other girl church member of Siufaga, Ana, a girl of
    nineteen. Her motives were entirely different. She was of a mild,
    quiescent nature, highly intelligent, very capable. She was the
    illegitimate child of a chief by a mother who had later married, run
    away, married again, been divorced, and finally gone off to another
    island. She formed no tie for Ana. Her father was a widower, living
    in a brother’s house and Ana had been reared in the family of another
    brother. This family approximated to a biological one; there were
    two married daughters older than Ana, a son near her age, a daughter
    of fourteen and a crowd of little children. The father was a gentle,
    retiring man who had built his house outside the village, “to escape
    from the noise,” he said. The two elder daughters married young and
    went away to live in their husbands’ households. Ana and her boy cousin
    both lived in the pastor’s household, while the next younger girl slept
    at home. The mother had a great distrust of men, especially of the
    young men of her own village. Ana should grow up to marry a pastor. She
    was not strong enough for the heavy work of the average Samoan wife.
    Her aunt’s continuous harping on this strain, which was prompted mainly
    by a dislike of Ana’s mother and a fear of the daughter’s leaving home
    to follow in her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>mother’s footsteps, had convinced Ana that she was a
    great deal too delicate for a normal existence. This theory received
    complete verification in the report of the doctor who examined the
    candidates for the nursing school and rejected her because of a heart
    murmur. Ana, influenced by her aunt’s gloomy foreboding, was now
    convinced that she was too frail to bear children, or at least not more
    than one child at some very distant date. She became a church member,
    gave up dancing, clung closer to the group of younger girls in the
    pastor’s school and to her foster home, the neurasthenic product of a
    physical defect, a small, isolated family group and the pastor’s school.</p>

  <p>These girls all represented the deviants from the pattern in one
    direction; they were those who demanded a different or improved
    environment, who rejected the traditional choices. At any time, they,
    like all deviants, might come into real conflict with the group. That
    they did not was an accident of environment. The younger girls in the
    pastor’s group as yet showed fewer signs of being influenced by their
    slightly artificial environment. They were chaste where they would not
    otherwise have been chaste, they had friends outside their relationship
    group whom they would otherwise have viewed with suspicion, they paid
    more attention to their lessons. They still had not acquired a desire
    to substitute any other career for the traditional one of marriage.
    This was, of course, partly due to the fact that the pastor’s school
    was simply one influence in their lives. The girls <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>still spent the
    greater proportion of their waking time at home amid conventional
    surroundings. Unless a girl was given some additional stimulus, such
    as unusual home conditions, or possessed peculiarities of temperament,
    she was likely to pass through the school essentially unchanged in
    her fundamental view of life. She would acquire a greater respect for
    the church, a preference for slightly more fastidious living, greater
    confidence in other girls. At the same time the pastor’s school
    offered a sufficient contrast to traditional Samoan life to furnish
    the background against which deviation could flourish. Girls who left
    the village and spent several years in the boarding school under the
    tutelage of white teachers were enormously influenced. Many of them
    became nurses; the majority married pastors, usually a deviation in
    attitude, involving as it did, acceptance of a different style of
    living.</p>

  <p>So, while religion itself offered little field for conflict, the
    institutions promoted by religion might act as stimuli to new choices
    and when sufficiently reinforced by other conditions might produce
    a type of girl who deviated markedly from her companions. That the
    majority of Samoan girls are still unaffected by these influences
    and pursue uncritically the traditional mode of life is simply a
    testimony to the resistance of the native culture, which in its present
    slightly Europeanised state, is replete with easy solutions for all
    conflicts; and to the apparent fact that adolescent girls in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>Samoa do
    not generate their own conflicts, but require a vigorous stimulus to
    produce them.</p>

  <p>These conflicts which have been discussed are conflicts of children who
    deviate upwards, who wish to exercise more choice than is traditionally
    permissible, and who, in making their choices, come to unconventional
    and bizarre solutions. The untraditional choices which are encouraged
    by the educational system inaugurated by the missionaries are education
    and the pursuit of a career and marriage outside of the local group (in
    the case of native pastors, teachers and nurses), preference for the
    society of one’s own sex through prolonged and close association in
    school, a self-conscious evaluation of existence, and the consequent
    making of self-conscious choices. All of these make for increased
    specialisation, increased sophistication, greater emphasis upon
    individuality, where an individual makes a conscious choice between
    alternate or opposing lines of conduct. In the case of this group of
    girls, it is evident that the mere presentation of conflicting choices
    was not sufficient but that real conflict required the yeast of a need
    for choice and in addition a culturally favourable batter in which to
    work.</p>

  <p>It will now be necessary to discuss another type of deviant, the
    deviant in a downward direction, or the delinquent. I am using the term
    delinquent to describe the individual who is maladjusted to the demands
    of her civilisation, and who comes definitely into conflict <span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>with her
    group, not because she adheres to a different standard, but because she
    violates the group standards which are also her own.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

  <div class="footnote">
    <a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> Such a distinction might well be made in the attitude
      towards delinquency in our own civilisation. Delinquency cannot be
      defined even within one culture in terms of acts alone, but attitudes
      should also be considered. Thus the child who rifles her mother’s
      purse to get money to buy food for a party or clothes to wear to a
      dance hall, who believes stealing is wrong, but cannot or will not
      resist the temptation to steal, is a delinquent, if the additional
      legal definition is given to her conduct by bringing her before some
      judicial authority. The young Christian communist who gives away her
      own clothes and also those of her brothers and sisters may be a menace
      to her family and to a society based upon private property, but she is
      not delinquent in the same sense. She has simply chosen an alternative
      standard. The girl who commits sex offences with all attendant shame,
      guilt, and inability to defend herself from becoming continually more
      involved in a course of action which she is conscious is “wrong,” until
      she becomes a social problem as an unmarried mother or a prostitute,
      is, of course, delinquent. The young advocate of free love who
      possesses a full quiver of ideals and sanctions for her conduct, may
      be undesirable, but from the standpoint of this discussion, she is not
      delinquent.
  </div>

  <p>A Samoan family or a Samoan community might easily come to conceive the
    conduct and standards of Sona and Lita as anti-social and undesirable.
    Each was following a plan of life which would not lead to marriage
    and children. Such a choice on the part of the females of any human
    community is, of course, likely to be frowned upon. The girls who,
    responding to the same stimuli, follow Sona’s and Lita’s example in the
    future will also run this risk.</p>

  <p>But were there really delinquent girls in this little primitive
    village, girls who were incapable of developing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> new standards and
    incapable of adjusting themselves to the old ones? My group included
    two girls who might be so described, one girl who was just reaching
    puberty, the other a girl two years past puberty. Their delinquency was
    not a new phenomenon, but in both cases dated back several years. The
    members of their respective groups unhesitatingly pronounced them “bad
    girls,” their age mates avoided them, and their relatives regretted
    them. As the Samoan village had no legal machinery for dealing with
    such cases, these are the nearest parallels which it is possible to
    draw with our “delinquent girl,” substituting definite conflict with
    unorganised group disapproval for the conflict with the law which
    defines delinquency in our society.</p>

  <p>Lola was seventeen, a tall, splendidly developed, intelligent hoyden.
    She had an unusual endowment in her capacity for strong feeling, for
    enthusiasms, for violent responses to individuals. Her father had died
    when she was a child and she had been reared in a headless house. Her
    father’s brother who was the <i lang="sm">matai</i> had several houses and he
    had scattered his large group of dependants in several different parts
    of the village. So Lola, two older sisters, two younger sisters, and
    a brother a year older, were brought up by their mother, a kindly but
    ineffective woman. The eldest sister married and left the village
    when Lola was eight. The next sister, Sami, five years older than
    Lola, was like her mother, mild and gentle, with a soft undercurrent
    of resentment towards life running through all her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>quiet words. She
    resented and disliked her younger sister but she was no match for her.
    Nito, her brother, was a high-spirited and intelligent youth who might
    have taught his sister a little wisdom had it not been for the brother
    and sister taboo which kept them always upon a formal footing. Aso,
    two years younger, was like Sami without Sami’s sullen resentment.
    She adopted the plan of keeping out of Lola’s way. The youngest,
    Siva, was like Lola, intelligent, passionate, easily aroused, but
    she was only eleven and merely profited by her sister’s bad example.
    Lola was quarrelsome, insubordinate, impertinent. She contended every
    point, objected to every request, shirked her work, fought with her
    sisters, mocked her mother, went about the village with a chip upon
    her shoulder. When she was fourteen, she became so unmanageable at
    home that her uncle sent her to live in the pastor’s household. She
    stayed there through a year of stormy scenes until she was finally
    expelled after a fight with Mala, the other delinquent. That she was
    not expelled sooner was out of deference to her rank as the niece of
    a leading chief. Her uncle realised the folly of sending her back to
    her mother. She was almost sixteen and well developed physically; and
    could be expected to add sex offences to the list of her troublesome
    activities at any moment. He took her to live in his own household
    under the supervision of his very strong-minded, executive wife, Pusa.
    Lola stayed there almost a year. It was a more interesting household
    than any in which she had lived. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>Her uncle’s rank made constant calls
    upon her. She learned to make kava well, to dance with greater ease and
    mastery. A trip to Tutuila relieved the monotony of life; two cousins
    from another island came to visit, and there was much gaiety about the
    house. As consciousness of sex became more acute, she became slightly
    subdued and tentative in her manner. Pusa was a hard task master and
    for a while Lola seemed to enjoy the novelty of a strong will backed by
    real authority. But the novelty wore off. The cousins prolonged their
    visit month after month. They persisted in treating her as a child. She
    became bored, sullen, jealous. Finally she ran away to other relatives,
    a very high chief’s family, in the next village. Here, temporarily,
    was another house group of women folk, as the head of the house was in
    Tutuila, and his wife, his mother and his two children were the only
    occupants of the great guest house. Lola’s labour was welcomed, and
    she set herself to currying favour with the high chief of the family.
    At first this was quite easy, as she had run away from the household
    of a rival chief and he appreciated her public defection. There were
    only much younger or much older girls in his household. Lola received
    the attention which she craved. The little girls resented her, but
    secretly admired her dashing uncompromising manner. But she had only
    been established here about a month when another chief, with a young
    and beautiful <i lang="sm">taupo</i> in his train, came to visit her new chief
    and the whole party was lodged in the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>very house where she slept.
    Now began an endless round of hospitable tasks, and worst of all
    she must wait upon the pretty stranger who was a year younger than
    herself, but whose rank as visiting <i lang="sm">taupo</i> gave her precedence.
    Lola again became troublesome. She quarrelled with the younger
    girls, was impertinent to the older ones, shirked her work, talked
    spitefully against the stranger. Perhaps all of this might have been
    only temporary and had no more far-reaching results than a temporary
    lack of favour in her new household, had it not been for a still more
    unfortunate event. The Don Juan of the village was a sleek, discreet
    man of about forty, a widower, a <i lang="sm">matai</i>, a man of circumspect
    manner and winning ways. He was looking for a second wife and turned
    his attention toward the visitor who was lodged in the guest house of
    the next village. But Fuativa was a cautious and calculating lover.
    He wished to look over his future bride carefully and so he visited
    her house casually, without any declaration of his intention. And he
    noticed that Lola had reached a robust girlhood and stopped to pluck
    this ready fruit by the way, while he was still undecided about the
    more serious business of matrimony.</p>

  <p>With all her capacity for violence, Lola possessed also a strong
    capacity for affection. Fuativa was a skilled and considerate lover.
    Few girls were quite so fortunate in their first lovers, and so few
    felt such unmixed regret when the first love affair was broken off.
    Fuativa won her easily and after three weeks which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>were casual to him,
    and very important to her, he proposed for the hand of the visitor.
    The proposal itself might not have so completely enraged Lola although
    her pride was sorely wounded. Still, plans to marry a bride from such
    a great distance might miscarry. But the affianced girl so obviously
    demurred from the marriage that the talking chiefs became frightened.
    Fuativa was a rich man and the marriage ceremony would bring many
    perquisites for the talking chief. If the girl was allowed to go home
    and plead with her parents, or given the opportunity to elope with
    some one else, there would be no wedding perhaps and no rewards. The
    public defloration ceremony is forbidden by law. That the bridegroom
    was a government employé would further complicate his position should
    he break the law. So the anxious talking chief and the anxious suitor
    made their plans and he was given access to his future bride. The rage
    of Lola was unbounded and she took an immediate revenge, publicly
    accusing her rival of being a thief and setting the whole village by
    the ears. The women of the host household drove her out with many
    imprecations and she fled home to her mother, thus completing the
    residence cycle begun four years ago. She was now in the position of
    the delinquent in our society. She had continuously violated the group
    standards and she had exhausted all the solutions open to her. No other
    family group would open its doors to a girl whose record branded her
    as a liar, a trouble maker, a fighter, and a thief, for her misdeeds
    included <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>continual petty thievery. Had she quarrelled with a father
    or been outraged by a brother-in-law, a refuge would have been easy to
    find. But her personality was essentially unfortunate. In her mother’s
    household she made her sisters miserable, but she did not lord it over
    them as she had done before. She was sullen, bitter, vituperative. The
    young people of the village branded her as the possessor of a <i lang="sm">lotu
    le aga</i>, (“a bad heart”) and she had no companions. Her young rival
    left the island to prepare for her wedding, or the next chapter might
    have been Lola’s doing her actual physical violence. When I left, she
    was living, idle, sullen, and defiant in her long-suffering mother’s
    house.</p>

  <p>Mala’s sins were slightly otherwise. Where Lola was violent, Mala was
    treacherous; where Lola was antagonistic, Mala was insinuating. Mala
    was younger, having just reached puberty in January, the middle of
    my stay on the island. She was a scrawny, ill-favoured little girl,
    always untidily dressed. Her parents were dead and she lived with
    her uncle, a sour, disgruntled man of small position. His wife came
    from another village and disliked her present home. The marriage was
    childless. The only other member of the house group was another niece
    who had divorced her husband. She also was childless. None showed
    Mala any affection, and they worked her unmercifully. The life of the
    only young girl or boy in a Samoan house, in the very rare cases when
    it occurs, is always very difficult. In this case it was doubly so.
    Ordinarily other relatives <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>in the neighbourhood would have handed
    their babies over to her care, giving her a share in the activities
    of happier and more populous households. But from her early childhood
    she had been branded as a thief, a dangerous charge in a country where
    there are no doors or locks, and houses are left empty for a day at a
    time. Her first offence had been to steal a foreign toy which belonged
    to the chief’s little son. The irate mother had soundly berated the
    child, on boat day, on the beach where all the people were gathered.
    When her name was mentioned, the information that she was a thief and
    a liar was tacked on as casually as was the remark that another was
    cross-eyed or deaf. Other children avoided her. Next door lived Tino,
    a dull good child, a few months younger than Mala. Ordinarily these
    two would have been companions and Mala always insisted that Tino was
    her friend, but Tino indignantly disclaimed all association with her.
    And as if her reputation for thievery were not sufficient, she added a
    further misdemeanour. She played with boys, preferred boys’ games, tied
    her <i lang="sm">lavalava</i> like a boy. This behaviour was displayed to the
    whole village who were vociferous in their condemnation. “She really
    was a very bad girl. She stole; she lied; and she played with boys.”
    As in other parts of the world, the whole odium fell on the girl, so
    the boys did not fight shy of her. They teased her, bullied her, used
    her as general errand boy and fag. Some of the more precocious boys of
    her own age were already beginning to look to her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>for possibilities of
    other forms of amusement. Probably she will end by giving her favours
    to whoever asks for them, and sink lower and lower in the village
    esteem and especially in the opinion of her own sex from whom she so
    passionately desires recognition and affection.</p>

  <p>Lola and Mala both seemed to be the victims of lack of affection. They
    both had unusual capacity for devotion and were abnormally liable
    to become jealous. Both responded with pathetic swiftness to any
    manifestations of affection. At one end of the scale in their need for
    affection, they were unfortunately placed at the other end in their
    chance of receiving it. Lola had a double handicap in her unfortunate
    temperament and the greater amiability of her three sisters. Her
    temperamental defects were further aggravated by the absence of any
    strong authority in her immediate household. Sami, the docile sister,
    had been saddled with the care of the younger children; Lola, harder
    to control, was given no such saving responsibility. These conditions
    were all as unusual as her demand and capacity for affection. And,
    similarly, seldom were children as desolate as Mala, marooned in a
    household of unsympathetic adults. So it would appear that their
    delinquency was produced by the combination of two sets of casual
    factors, unusual emotional needs and unusual home conditions. Less
    affectionate children in the same environments, or the same children
    in more favourable surroundings, probably would never have become as
    definitely outcast as these. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>Only one other girl in the three villages
    calls for consideration under this conception of delinquency and she
    received far less general condemnation than either of the others. This
    was Sala, who lived in the third village. She lived in a household of
    seven, consisting of her widowed mother, her younger brother of ten,
    her grandmother, her uncle and his wife, and their two-year-old son.
    This presented a fairly well-balanced family group and there were in
    addition many other relatives close by. Sala had been sent to live
    in the pastor’s house but had speedily got involved in sex offences
    and been expelled. Her attitude towards this pastor was still one of
    unveiled hostility. She was stupid, underhanded, deceitful and she
    possessed no aptitude for the simplest mechanical tasks. Her ineptness
    was the laughing stock of the village and her lovers were many and
    casual, the fathers of illegitimate children, men whose wives were
    temporarily absent, witless boys bent on a frolic. It was a saying
    among the girls of the village that Sala was apt at only one art, sex,
    and that she, who couldn’t even sew thatch or weave blinds, would never
    get a husband. The social attitude towards her was one of contempt,
    rather than of antagonism, and she had experienced it keenly enough to
    have sunk very low in her own eyes. She had a sullen furtive manner,
    lied extravagantly in her assertions of skill and knowledge, and was
    ever on the alert for slights and possible innuendoes. She came into no
    serious conflict with her community. Her father <span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>beat her occasionally
    in a half-hearted manner, but her stupidity was her salvation for the
    Samoan possesses more charity towards weakness than towards misdirected
    strength. Sooner or later Sala’s random sex experiences will probably
    lead to pregnancy, resulting in a temporary restriction of her
    activities and a much greater dependency upon her family. This economic
    dependence which in her case will be reinforced by her lack of manual
    skill will be strong enough to give her family a whip hand over her and
    force her to at least moderate her experimentation. She may not marry
    for many years and possibly will always be rated too inefficient for
    such responsibility.</p>

  <p>The only delinquent in the making, that is a child who showed
    marked possibilities of increasing misbehaviour, was Siva, Lola’s
    eleven-year-old little sister. She had the same obstreperous nature and
    was always engaging in fist fights with the other children, or hurling
    deadly insults after fleeing backs. She had the same violent craving
    for affection. But her uncle, profiting by her sister’s unfortunate
    development, had taken her at the age of ten into his immediate family
    and so she was spending her pre-adolescent years under a much firmer
    régime than had her sister. And she differed from her sister in one
    respect, which was likely to prove her salvation. Where Lola had no
    sense of humour and no lightness of touch, Siva had both. She was a
    gifted mimic, an excruciatingly funny dancer, a born comedian. People
    forgave her her violence and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>her quarrelsomeness for sheer mirth over
    her propitiatory antics. If this facility continues to endear her to
    her aunts and cousins, who already put up with any number of pranks
    and fits of temper from her, she will probably not follow in her
    sister’s steps. One affectionate word makes her shift her attention,
    and she has a real gift for affection. Once at a dancing party I had
    especially requested the children to be good and not waste time in
    endless bickerings and jealousies. I selected three little girls, the
    traditional number, to dance, and one of them, Meta, claimed that she
    had a sore foot. I turned hastily to Siva and asked her to fill out the
    figure. She was preparing to do so, with none too good grace at being
    second choice, when Meta, who had merely been holding back for more
    urging, leaped to her feet, and took the empty place. Siva was doubling
    up her fists ready to fly at Meta’s throat when she caught my eye. She
    swallowed furiously, and then jerked the flower wreath from around
    her own neck and flung it over Meta’s head. With better luck than her
    sister, she will not come into lasting conflict with her society.</p>

  <p>And here ends the tale of serious conflict or serious deviation from
    group standards. The other girls varied as to whether they were
    subjected to the superior supervision of the pastor’s household or not,
    as to whether they came from households of rank or families of small
    prestige, and most of all as to whether they lived in a biological
    family or a large heterogeneous household. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>But with differences in
    temperament equal to those found among us, though with a possibly
    narrower range of intellectual ability, they showed a surprising
    uniformity of knowledge, skill and attitude, and presented a picture
    of orderly, regular development in a flexible, but strictly delimited,
    environment.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">MATURITY AND OLD AGE</div>

  <p>Because the community makes no distinction between unmarried girls and
    the wives of untitled men in the demands which it makes upon them, and
    because there is seldom any difference in sex experience between the
    two groups, the dividing line falls not between married and unmarried
    but between grown women and growing girls in industrial activity and
    between the wives of <i lang="sm">matais</i> and their less important sisters
    in ceremonial affairs. The girl of twenty-two or twenty-three who is
    still unmarried loses her laissez faire attitude. Family pressure is an
    effective cause in bringing about this change. She is an adult, as able
    as her married sisters and her brothers’ young wives; she is expected
    to contribute as heavily as they to household undertakings. She lives
    among a group of contemporaries upon whom the responsibilities of
    marriage are making increased demands. Rivalry and emulation enter in.
    And also she may be becoming a little anxious about her own marital
    chances. The first preoccupation with sex experimentation has worn
    itself out and she settles down to increase her value as a wife. In
    native theory a girl knows how to sew thatch, but doesn’t really make
    thatch until she is married. In actual practice the adult <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>unmarried
    girls perform household and agricultural tasks identical with those
    performed by their married sisters, except that whereas pregnancy
    and nursing children tie the young married women to the house, the
    unmarried girls are free to go off on long fishing expeditions, or far
    inland in search of weaving materials.</p>

  <p>A married couple may live either in the household of the girl or of the
    boy, choice being made on the basis of rank, or the industrial needs of
    the two households. The change of residence makes much less difference
    to the girl than to the boy. A married woman’s life is lived in such a
    narrow sphere that her only associates are the women of her household.
    Residence in her husband’s village instead of her own does not narrow
    her life, for her participation in village affairs will remain slight
    and unimportant until her husband assumes a title which confers status
    upon her also. If her husband’s household is in her own village, her
    responsibilities will be increased somewhat because she will be subject
    to continual demands from her own near relatives as well as from those
    of her husband.</p>

  <p>There is no expectation of conflict between daughter-in-law and
    mother-in-law. The mother-in-law must be respected because she is
    an elder of the household and an insolent daughter-in-law is no
    more tolerated than an insubordinate daughter or niece. But tales
    of the traditional lack of harmony which exists in our civilisation
    were treated by the Samoans with contemptuous <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>amusement. Where the
    emotional ties between parents and children are so weak, it was
    impossible to make them see it as an issue between a man’s mother and
    man’s wife, in which jealousy played a part. They saw it simply as
    failure on the part of the young and unimportant person to pay proper
    respect to the old, granting of course that there were always irascible
    old people from whom it was expedient to move away. The same thing
    holds true for the young man, if he goes to live in his father-in-law’s
    house. If the father-in-law is the <i lang="sm">matai</i>, he has complete
    authority over his daughter’s husband; if he is only an untitled old
    man, he must still be treated with respect.</p>

  <p>But change of village for the young man makes a great difference,
    because he must take his place in a new <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, and work with
    strangers instead of with the boys with whom he has worked and played
    since childhood. Very often he never becomes as thoroughly assimilated
    to the new group as he was to the old. He stands more upon his dignity.
    He works with his new companions but does not play with them. The
    social life of the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> centres about the group courtesies
    which they pay to visiting girls. In his own village a man will
    accompany the younger boys on these occasions for many years after he
    is married. But in his wife’s village, such behaviour becomes suddenly
    less appropriate. Random amatory adventures are also more hazardous
    when he is living as a member of his wife’s household. And although
    his transition from <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>the status of a young man to the status of a
    <i lang="sm">matai</i> is easier, he ages more quickly; although he may earn
    great respect in his adopted village, he commands less of its affection.</p>

  <p>In most marriages there is no sense of setting up a new and separate
    establishment. The change is felt in the change of residence for either
    husband or wife and in the reciprocal relations which spring up between
    the two families. But the young couple live in the main household,
    simply receiving a bamboo pillow, a mosquito net and a pile of mats
    for their bed. Only for the chief or the chief’s son is a new house
    built. The wife works with all the women of the household and waits
    upon all the men. The husband shares the enterprises of the other men
    and boys. Neither in personal service given or received are the two
    marked off as a unit. Nor does marriage of either brother or sister
    slacken the avoidance rules; it merely adds another individual, the
    new sister or brother-in-law, to whom the whole series of avoidances
    must be applied. In the sexual relation alone are the two treated as
    one. For even in the care of the young children and in the decisions as
    to their future, the uncles and aunts and grandparents participate as
    fully as the parents. It is only when a man is <i lang="sm">matai</i> as well as
    father, that he has control over his own children; and when this is so,
    the relationship is blurred in opposite fashion, for he has the same
    control over many other young people who are less closely related to
    him. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>The pregnant young wife is surrounded by a multitude of taboos,
    most of which are prohibitions against solitary activities. She must
    not walk alone, sit alone, dance alone, gather food alone, eat alone,
    or when only her husband is present. All of these taboos are explained
    by the amiable doctrine that only things which are wrong are done in
    solitude and that any wrong deed committed by the expectant mother
    will injure the child. It seems simpler to prohibit solitary acts
    than wrong ones. There are also ghosts which are particularly likely
    to injure the pregnant woman, and she is warned against walking in
    ghost-ridden places. She is warned against doing too heavy work and
    against getting chilled or overheated. While pregnancy is not treated
    with anything like the consideration which is often given it here, her
    first pregnancy gives a woman a certain amount of social prominence.
    This prominence is in direct proportion to her rank, and the young wife
    whose child is the presumptive heir to some high title is watched over
    with great solicitude. Relatives gather from great distances for the
    confinement and birth feast, which is described as the mother’s feast,
    rather than the feast in honour of either child or father.</p>

  <p>After the birth of the first child, the other children arrive
    frequently and with small remark. Old gossips count them and comment
    on the number living, dead or miscarried in previous births. A pig
    is roasted for the birth feast to which only the near relatives are
    invited. The mother of many children is rather taken for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>granted
    than praised. The barren woman is mildly execrated and her misfortune
    attributed to loose living. There were three barren older women on Taū;
    all three were midwives and reputed to be very wise. Now well past
    the child-bearing age, they were reaping the reward of the greater
    application to the intricacies of their calling with which they had
    compensated for their barrenness.</p>

  <p>The young married women of twenty to thirty are a busy, cheerful
    group. They become church members and wear hats to church. When they
    have not a baby at the breast, they are doing heavy work on the
    plantations, fishing or making tapa. No other important event will
    ever happen to them again. If their husbands die, they will probably
    take new husbands, and those of lower rank. If their husbands become
    <i lang="sm">matais</i>, they will also acquire a place in the <i lang="sm">fono</i> of the
    women. But it is only the woman with a flair for political wire-pulling
    and the luck to have either important relatives or an important husband
    who gets any real satisfaction out of the social organisation of the
    village.</p>

  <p>The young men do not settle as early into a groove. What her first
    child is to a woman his title is to a man, and while each new child is
    less of an event in her life, a new title is always a higher one and
    a greater event in his. A man rarely attains his first title before
    he is thirty, often not before he is forty. All the years between his
    entrance into the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> and his entrance into the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>
    are years of striving. He cannot acquire <span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>a reputation and then rest
    upon it or another claimant to the same title will take advantage of
    his indolence and pass him in the race. One good catch of fish does
    not make him a fisherman nor one housebeam neatly adzed, a carpenter;
    the whole emphasis is upon a steady demonstration of increasing skill
    which will be earnest of the necessary superiority over his fellows.
    Only the lazy, the shiftless, the ambitionless fail to respond to
    this competition. The one exception to this is in the case of the
    son or heir of the high chief who may be made the <i lang="sm">manaia</i> at
    twenty. But here his high rank has already subjected him to more
    rigorous discipline and careful training than the other youths, and as
    <i lang="sm">manaia</i>, he is the titular head of the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i>, and must
    lead it well or lose his prestige.</p>

  <p>Once having acquired a <i lang="sm">matai</i> name and entered the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>,
    differences in temperament prevail. The <i lang="sm">matai</i> name he receives
    may be a very small one, carrying with it no right to a post in
    the council house, or other prerogatives. It may be so small that
    <i lang="sm">matai</i> though he is, he does not try to command a household,
    but lives instead in the shadow of some more important relative. But
    he will be a member of the <i lang="sm">Fono</i>, classed with the elders of
    the village, and removed forever from the hearty group activities of
    the young men. Should he become a widower and wish to court a new
    wife, he can only do so by laying aside his <i lang="sm">matai</i> name and
    entering her house under the fiction that he is still a youth. His main
    preoccupation is the affairs of the village; his <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>main diversion, hours
    spent in ceremonious argument in some meeting. He always carries his
    bundle of beaten cocoanut fibre and as he talks, he rolls the fibres
    together on his bare thigh.</p>

  <p>The less ambitious rest upon this achievement. The more ambitious
    continue the game, for higher titles, for greater prestige as craftsmen
    or orators, for the control of more strings in the political game. At
    last the preference for the most able, the very preference which, in
    defiance of laws of primogeniture or direct descent, may have given a
    man his title, takes it away from him. For should he live beyond his
    prime, fifty-five or sixty, his name is taken from him and given to
    another, and he is given a “little <i lang="sm">matai</i> name,” so that he may
    still sit with the other <i lang="sm">matais</i> and drink his kava. These old
    men stay at home, guard the house while the others go inland to the
    plantations, superintend the children, braid cinet and give advice,
    or in a final perverse assertion of authority, fail to give it. One
    young chief who had been given his father’s name during his father’s
    lifetime, complained to me: “I had no old man to help me. My father was
    angry that his title was given to me and he would tell me nothing. My
    mother was wise but she came from another island and did not know well
    the ancient ways of our village. There was no old one in the house to
    sit with me in the evening and fill my ears with the things from the
    olden time. A young <i lang="sm">matai</i> should always have an old man beside
    him, who, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>even though he is deaf and cannot always hear his questions,
    can still tell him many things.”</p>

  <p>The women’s lives pursue a more even tenor. The wives of chiefs and
    talking chiefs have to give some time to the mastery of ceremonial.
    The old women who become midwives or doctors pursue their professions
    but seldom and in a furtive, private fashion. The menopause is marked
    by some slight temperamental instability, irritability, finickiness
    about food, a tendency to sudden whims and inexplicable fancies. Once
    past the menopause and relieved of child-bearing, a woman turns her
    attention again to the heavy work of the plantations. The hardest work
    of the village is done by women between forty-five and fifty-five.
    Then, as age approaches, she settles down to performing the skilled
    tasks in the household, to weaving and tapa making.</p>

  <p>Where a man is disqualified from active work by rheumatism,
    elephantiasis, or general feebleness, his rôle as a teacher is
    diminished. He can teach the aspirant young fisherman the lore of
    fishing but not the technique. The old woman on the other hand is
    mistress of housebound crafts and to her must go the girl who is
    ambitious to become a skilled weaver. Another can gather the herbs
    which she needs for her medicines, while she keeps the secret of
    compounding them. The ceremonial burning of the candle-nut to obtain
    black dye is in the hands of very old women. And also these <span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>old women
    are usually more of a power within the household than the old men. The
    men rule partly by the authority conferred by their titles, but their
    wives and sisters rule by force of personality and knowledge of human
    nature. A life-long preoccupation within the smaller group makes them
    omniscient and tyrannical. They suffer no diminution of prestige except
    such as is inherent in the complete loss of their faculties.</p>

  <p>The feeling for generation is retained until death, and the very old
    people sit in the sun and talk softly without regard for taboo or sex.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">OUR EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS IN THE LIGHT OF SAMOAN CONTRASTS</div>

  <p>For many chapters we have followed the lives of Samoan girls, watched
    them change from babies to baby-tenders, learn to make the oven and
    weave fine mats, forsake the life of the gang to become more active
    members of the household, defer marriage through as many years of
    casual love-making as possible, finally marry and settle down to
    rearing children who will repeat the same cycle. As far as our material
    permitted, an experiment has been conducted to discover what the
    process of development was like in a society very different from our
    own. Because the length of human life and the complexity of our society
    did not permit us to make our experiment here, to choose a group of
    baby girls and bring them to maturity under conditions created for
    the experiment, it was necessary to go instead to another country
    where history had set the stage for us. There we found girl children
    passing through the same process of physical development through which
    our girls go, cutting their first teeth and losing them, cutting
    their second teeth, growing tall and ungainly, reaching puberty with
    their first menstruation, gradually reaching physical maturity, and
    becoming <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>ready to produce the next generation. It was possible to
    say: Here are the proper conditions for an experiment; the developing
    girl is a constant factor in America and in Samoa; the civilisation
    of America and the civilisation of Samoa are different. In the course
    of development, the process of growth by which the girl baby becomes
    a grown woman, are the sudden and conspicuous bodily changes which
    take place at puberty accompanied by a development which is spasmodic,
    emotionally charged, and accompanied by an awakened religious sense,
    a flowering of idealism, a great desire for assertion of self against
    authority—or not? Is adolescence a period of mental and emotional
    distress for the growing girl as inevitably as teething is a period of
    misery for the small baby? Can we think of adolescence as a time in
    the life history of every girl child which carries with it symptoms of
    conflict and stress as surely as it implies a change in the girl’s body?</p>

  <p>Following the Samoan girls through every aspect of their lives we have
    tried to answer this question, and we found throughout that we had to
    answer it in the negative. The adolescent girl in Samoa differed from
    her sister who had not reached puberty in one chief respect, that in
    the older girl certain bodily changes were present which were absent
    in the younger girl. There were no other great differences to set off
    the group passing through adolescence from the group which would become
    adolescent in two years or the group which had become adolescent two
    years before. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>And if one girl past puberty is undersized while her
    cousin is tall and able to do heavier work, there will be a difference
    between them, due to their different physical endowment, which will be
    far greater than that which is due to puberty. The tall, husky girl
    will be isolated from her companions, forced to do longer, more adult
    tasks, rendered shy by a change of clothing, while her cousin, slower
    to attain her growth, will still be treated as a child and will have
    to solve only the slightly fewer problems of childhood. The precedent
    of educators here who recommend special tactics in the treatment of
    adolescent girls translated into Samoan terms would read: Tall girls
    are different from short girls of the same age, we must adopt a
    different method of educating them.</p>

  <p>But when we have answered the question we set out to answer we have not
    finished with the problem. A further question presents itself. If it is
    proved that adolescence is not necessarily a specially difficult period
    in a girl’s life—and proved it is if we can find any society in which
    that is so—then what accounts for the presence of storm and stress in
    American adolescents? First, we may say quite simply, that there must
    be something in the two civilisations to account for the difference. If
    the same process takes a different form, in two different environments,
    we cannot make any explanations in terms of the process, for that is
    the same in both cases. But the social environment is very different
    and it is to it that we must look for an explanation. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>What is there
    in Samoa which is absent in America, what is there in America which is
    absent in Samoa, which will account for this difference?</p>

  <p>Such a question has enormous implications and any attempt to answer it
    will be subject to many possibilities of error. But if we narrow our
    question to the way in which aspects of Samoan life which irremediably
    affect the life of the adolescent girl differ from the forces which
    influence our growing girls, it is possible to try to answer it.</p>

  <p>The background of these differences is a broad one, with two important
    components; one is due to characteristics which are Samoan, the other
    to characteristics which are primitive.</p>

  <p>The Samoan background which makes growing up so easy, so simple a
    matter, is the general casualness of the whole society. For Samoa is a
    place where no one plays for very high stakes, no one pays very heavy
    prices, no one suffers for his convictions or fights to the death for
    special ends. Disagreements between parent and child are settled by
    the child’s moving across the street, between a man and his village
    by the man’s removal to the next village, between a husband and his
    wife’s seducer by a few fine mats. Neither poverty nor great disasters
    threaten the people to make them hold their lives dearly and tremble
    for continued existence. No implacable gods, swift to anger and strong
    to punish, disturb the even tenor of their days. Wars and cannibalism
    are long since passed away and now the greatest cause for <span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>tears,
    short of death itself, is a journey of a relative to another island.
    No one is hurried along in life or punished harshly for slowness
    of development. Instead the gifted, the precocious, are held back,
    until the slowest among them have caught the pace. And in personal
    relations, caring is as slight. Love and hate, jealousy and revenge,
    sorrow and bereavement, are all matters of weeks. From the first months
    of its life, when the child is handed carelessly from one woman’s
    hands to another’s, the lesson is learned of not caring for one person
    greatly, not setting high hopes on any one relationship.</p>

  <p>And just as we may feel that the Occident penalises those unfortunates
    who are born into Western civilisation with a taste for meditation and
    a complete distaste for activity, so we may say that Samoa is kind to
    those who have learned the lesson of not caring, and hard upon those
    few individuals who have failed to learn it. Lola and Mala and little
    Siva, Lola’s sister, all were girls with a capacity for emotion greater
    than their fellows. And Lola and Mala, passionately desiring affection
    and too violently venting upon the community their disappointment over
    their lack of it, were both delinquent, unhappy misfits in a society
    which gave all the rewards to those who took defeat lightly and turned
    to some other goal with a smile.</p>

  <p>In this casual attitude towards life, in this avoidance of conflict,
    of poignant situations, Samoa contrasts strongly not only with America
    but also with most primitive <span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>civilisations. And however much we may
    deplore such an attitude and feel that important personalities and
    great art are not born in so shallow a society, we must recognise that
    here is a strong factor in the painless development from childhood to
    womanhood. For where no one feels very strongly, the adolescent will
    not be tortured by poignant situations. There are no such disastrous
    choices as those which confronted young people who felt that the
    service of God demanded forswearing the world forever, as in the Middle
    Ages, or cutting off one’s finger as a religious offering, as among the
    Plains Indians. So, high up in our list of explanations we must place
    the lack of deep feeling which the Samoans have conventionalised until
    it is the very framework of all their attitudes toward life.</p>

  <p>And next there is the most striking way in which all isolated primitive
    civilisation and many modern ones differ from our own, in the number
    of choices which are permitted to each individual. Our children grow
    up to find a world of choices dazzling their unaccustomed eyes. In
    religion they may be Catholics, Protestants, Christian Scientists,
    Spiritualists, Agnostics, Atheists, or even pay no attention at all to
    religion. This is an unthinkable situation in any primitive society not
    exposed to foreign influence. There is one set of gods, one accepted
    religious practice, and if a man does not believe, his only recourse
    is to believe less than his fellows; he may scoff but there is no
    new faith to which he may turn. Present-day Manu’a approximates this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>condition; all are Christians of the same sect. There is no conflict
    in matters of belief although there is a difference in practice between
    Church-members and non-Church-members. And it was remarked that in
    the case of several of the growing girls the need for choice between
    these two practices may some day produce a conflict. But at present the
    Church makes too slight a bid for young unmarried members to force the
    adolescent to make any decision.</p>

  <p>Similarly, our children are faced with half a dozen standards of
    morality: a double sex standard for men and women, a single standard
    for men and women, and groups which advocate that the single standard
    should be freedom while others argue that the single standard should
    be absolute monogamy. Trial marriage, companionate marriage, contract
    marriage—all these possible solutions of a social impasse are paraded
    before the growing children while the actual conditions in their own
    communities and the moving pictures and magazines inform them of mass
    violations of every code, violations which march under no banners of
    social reform.</p>

  <p>The Samoan child faces no such dilemma. Sex is a natural, pleasurable
    thing; the freedom with which it may be indulged in is limited by
    just one consideration, social status. Chiefs’ daughters and chiefs’
    wives should indulge in no extra-marital experiments. Responsible
    adults, heads of households and mothers of families should have too
    many important matters on <span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>hand to leave them much time for casual
    amorous adventures. Every one in the community agrees about the matter,
    the only dissenters are the missionaries who dissent so vainly that
    their protests are unimportant. But as soon as a sufficient sentiment
    gathers about the missionary attitude with its European standard of sex
    behaviour, the need for choice, the forerunner of conflict, will enter
    into Samoan society.</p>

  <p>Our young people are faced by a series of different groups which
    believe different things and advocate different practices, and to each
    of which some trusted friend or relative may belong. So a girl’s father
    may be a Presbyterian, an imperialist, a vegetarian, a teetotaler, with
    a strong literary preference for Edmund Burke, a believer in the open
    shop and a high tariff, who believes that woman’s place is in the home,
    that young girls should wear corsets, not roll their stockings, not
    smoke, nor go riding with young men in the evening. But her mother’s
    father may be a Low Episcopalian, a believer in high living, a strong
    advocate of States’ Rights and the Monroe Doctrine, who reads Rabelais,
    likes to go to musical shows and horse races. Her aunt is an agnostic,
    an ardent advocate of woman’s rights, an internationalist who rests
    all her hopes on Esperanto, is devoted to Bernard Shaw, and spends
    her spare time in campaigns of anti-vivisection. Her elder brother,
    whom she admires exceedingly, has just spent two years at Oxford. He
    is an Anglo-Catholic, an enthusiast concerning all things mediæval,
    writes mystical poetry, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>reads Chesterton, and means to devote his
    life to seeking for the lost secret of mediæval stained glass. Her
    mother’s younger brother is an engineer, a strict materialist, who
    never recovered from reading Haeckel in his youth; he scorns art,
    believes that science will save the world, scoffs at everything that
    was said and thought before the nineteenth century, and ruins his
    health by experiments in the scientific elimination of sleep. Her
    mother is of a quietistic frame of mind, very much interested in Indian
    philosophy, a pacifist, a strict non-participator in life, who in spite
    of her daughter’s devotion to her will not make any move to enlist
    her enthusiasms. And this may be within the girl’s own household. Add
    to it the groups represented, defended, advocated by her friends, her
    teachers, and the books which she reads by accident, and the list of
    possible enthusiasms, of suggested allegiances, incompatible with one
    another, becomes appalling.</p>

  <p>The Samoan girl’s choices are far otherwise. Her father is a member of
    the Church and so is her uncle. Her father lives in a village where
    there is good fishing, her uncle in a village where there are plenty
    of cocoanut crabs. Her father is a good fisherman and in his house
    there is plenty to eat; her uncle is a talking chief and his frequent
    presents of bark cloth provide excellent dance dresses. Her paternal
    grandmother, who lives with her uncle, can teach her many secrets of
    healing; her maternal grandmother, who lives with her mother, is an
    expert weaver of fans. The boys in her uncle’s <span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>village are admitted
    younger into the <i lang="sm">Aumaga</i> and are not much fun when they come to
    call; but there are three boys in her own village whom she likes very
    much. And her great dilemma is whether to live with her father or her
    uncle, a frank, straightforward problem which introduces no ethical
    perplexities, no question of impersonal logic. Nor will her choice be
    taken as a personal matter, as the American girl’s allegiance to the
    views of one relative might be interpreted by her other relatives. The
    Samoans will be sure she chose one residence rather than the other for
    perfectly good reasons, the food was better, she had a lover in one
    village, or she had quarrelled with a lover in the other village. In
    each case she was making concrete choices within one recognised pattern
    of behaviour. She was never called upon to make choices involving an
    actual rejection of the standards of her social group, such as the
    daughter of Puritan parents, who permits indiscriminate caresses, must
    make in our society.</p>

  <p>And not only are our developing children faced by a series of groups
    advocating different and mutually exclusive standards, but a more
    perplexing problem presents itself to them. Because our civilisation
    is woven of so many diverse strands, the ideas which any one group
    accepts will be found to contain numerous contradictions. So if the
    girl has given her allegiance whole-heartedly to some one group and
    has accepted in good faith their asseverations that they alone are
    right and all other philosophies of life are Antichrist and <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>anathema,
    her troubles are still not over. While the less thoughtful receives
    her worst blows in the discovery that what father thinks is good,
    grandfather thinks is bad, and that things which are permitted at
    home are banned at school, the more thoughtful child has subtler
    difficulties in store for her. If she has philosophically accepted the
    fact that there are several standards among which she must choose, she
    may still preserve a childlike faith in the coherence of her chosen
    philosophy. Beyond the immediate choice which was so puzzling and hard
    to make, which perhaps involved hurting her parents or alienating her
    friends, she expects peace. But she has not reckoned with the fact that
    each of the philosophies with which she is confronted is itself but
    the half-ripened fruit of compromise. If she accept Christianity, she
    is immediately confused between the Gospel teachings concerning peace
    and the value of human life and the Church’s whole-hearted acceptance
    of war. The compromise made seventeen centuries ago between the Roman
    philosophy of war and domination, and the early Church doctrine of
    peace and humility, is still present to confuse the modern child.
    If she accepts the philosophic premises upon which the Declaration
    of Independence of the United States was founded, she finds herself
    faced with the necessity of reconciling the belief in the equality
    of man and our institutional pledges of equality of opportunity
    with our treatment of the Negro and the Oriental. The diversity of
    standards in present-day society is so striking <span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>that the dullest,
    the most incurious, cannot fail to notice it. And this diversity is
    so old, so embodied in semi-solutions, in those compromises between
    different philosophies which we call Christianity, or democracy,
    or humanitarianism, that it baffles the most intelligent, the most
    curious, the most analytical.</p>

  <p>So for the explanation of the lack of poignancy in the choices of
    growing girls in Samoa, we must look to the temperament of the Samoan
    civilisation which discounts strong feeling. But for the explanation
    of the lack of conflict we must look principally to the difference
    between a simple, homogeneous primitive civilisation, a civilisation
    which changes so slowly that to each generation it appears static, and
    a motley, diverse, heterogeneous modern civilisation.</p>

  <p>And in making the comparison there is a third consideration, the
    lack of neuroses among the Samoans, the great number of neuroses
    among ourselves. We must examine the factors in the early education
    of the Samoan children which have fitted them for a normal,
    unneurotic development. The findings of the behaviourists and of the
    psychoanalysts alike lay great emphasis upon the enormous rôle which
    is played by the environment of the first few years. Children who have
    been given a bad start are often found to function badly later on
    when they are faced with important choices. And we know that the more
    severe the choice, the more conflict; the more poignancy is attached
    to the demands made upon the individual, the more neuroses will
    result. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>History, in the form of the last war, provided a stupendous
    illustration of the great number of maimed and handicapped individuals
    whose defects showed only under very special and terrible stress.
    Without the war, there is no reason to believe that many of these
    shell-shocked individuals might not have gone through life unremarked;
    the bad start, the fears, the complexes, the bad conditionings of early
    childhood, would never have borne positive enough fruit to attract the
    attention of society.</p>

  <p>The implications of this observation are double. Samoa’s lack of
    difficult situations, of conflicting choice, of situations in which
    fear or pain or anxiety are sharpened to a knife edge will probably
    account for a large part of the absence of psychological maladjustment.
    Just as a low-grade moron would not be hopelessly handicapped in
    Samoa, although he would be a public charge in a large American city,
    so individuals with slight nervous instability have a much more
    favourable chance in Samoa than in America. Furthermore the amount of
    individualisation, the range of variation, is much smaller in Samoa.
    Within our wider limits of deviation there are inevitably found weak
    and non-resistant temperaments. And just as our society shows a greater
    development of personality, so also it shows a larger proportion of
    individuals who have succumbed before the complicated exactions of
    modern life.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it is possible that there are factors in the early
    environment of the Samoan child which are <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>particularly favourable to
    the establishment of nervous stability. Just as a child from a better
    home environment in our civilisation may be presumed to have a better
    chance under all circumstances it is conceivable that the Samoan child
    is not only handled more gently by its culture but that it is also
    better equipped for those difficulties which it does meet.</p>

  <p>Such an assumption is given force by the fact that little Samoan
    children pass apparently unharmed through experiences which often have
    grave effects on individual development in our civilisation. Our life
    histories are filled with the later difficulties which can be traced
    back to some early, highly charged experience with sex or with birth
    or death. And yet Samoan children are familiarised at an early age
    and without disaster, with all three. It is very possible that there
    are aspects of the life of the young child in Samoa which equip it
    particularly well for passing through life without nervous instability.</p>

  <p>With this hypothesis in mind it is worth while to consider in more
    detail which parts of the young child’s social environment are most
    strikingly different from ours. Most of these centre about the family
    situation, the environment which impinges earliest and most intensely
    upon the child’s consciousness. The organisation of a Samoan household
    eliminates at one stroke, in almost all cases, many of the special
    situations which are believed to be productive of undesirable emotional
    sets. The youngest, the oldest, and the only child, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>hardly ever
    occur because of the large number of children in a household, all of
    whom receive the same treatment. Few children are weighted down with
    responsibility, or rendered domineering and overbearing as eldest
    children so often are, or isolated, condemned to the society of adults
    and robbed of the socialising effect of contact with other children, as
    only children so often are. No child is petted and spoiled until its
    view of its own deserts is hopelessly distorted, as is so often the
    fate of the youngest child. But in the few cases where Samoan family
    life does approximate ours, the special attitudes incident to order of
    birth and to close affectional ties with the parent tend to develop.</p>

  <p>The close relationship between parent and child, which has such a
    decisive influence upon so many in our civilisation, that submission to
    the parent or defiance of the parent may become the dominating pattern
    of a lifetime, is not found in Samoa. Children reared in households
    where there are a half dozen adult women to care for them and dry their
    tears, and a half dozen adult males, all of whom represent constituted
    authority, do not distinguish their parents as sharply as our children
    do. The image of the fostering, loving mother, or the admirable father,
    which may serve to determine affectional choices later in life, is a
    composite affair, composed of several aunts, cousins, older sisters and
    grandmothers; of chief, father, uncles, brothers and cousins. Instead
    of learning as its first lesson that here is a kind mother whose
    special and principal care is for its <span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>welfare, and a father whose
    authority is to be deferred to, the Samoan baby learns that its world
    is composed of a hierarchy of male and female adults, all of whom can
    be depended upon and must be deferred to.</p>

  <p>The lack of specialised feeling which results from this diffusion of
    affection in the household is further reinforced by the segregation of
    the boys from the girls, so that a child regards the children of the
    opposite sex as taboo relatives, regardless of individuality, or as
    present enemies and future lovers, again regardless of individuality.
    And the substitution of relationship for preference in forming
    friendships completes the work. By the time she reaches puberty the
    Samoan girl has learned to subordinate choice in the selection of
    friends or lovers to an observance of certain categories. Friends must
    be relatives of one’s own sex; lovers, non-relatives. All claim of
    personal attraction or congeniality between relatives of opposite sex
    must be flouted. All of this means that casual sex relations carry no
    onus of strong attachment, that the marriage of convenience dictated by
    economic and social considerations is easily born and casually broken
    without strong emotion.</p>

  <p>Nothing could present a sharper contrast to the average American home,
    with its small number of children, the close, theoretically permanent
    tie between the parents, the drama of the entrance of each new child
    upon the scene and the deposition of the last baby. Here the growing
    girl learns to depend upon a few individuals, to expect the rewards of
    life from certain <span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>kinds of personalities. With this first set towards
    preference in personal relations she grows up playing with boys as
    well as with girls, learning to know well brothers and cousins and
    schoolmates. She does not think of boys as a class but as individuals,
    nice ones like the brother of whom she is fond, or disagreeable,
    domineering ones, like a brother with whom she is always on bad terms.
    Preference in physical make-up, in temperament, in character, develops
    and forms the foundations for a very different adult attitude in which
    choice plays a vivid rôle. The Samoan girl never tastes the rewards of
    romantic love as we know it, nor does she suffer as an old maid who
    has appealed to no lover or found no lover appealing to her, or as the
    frustrated wife in a marriage which has not fulfilled her high demands.</p>

  <p>Having learned a little of the art of disciplining sex feeling into
    special channels approved by the whole personality, we will be inclined
    to account our solution better than the Samoans. To attain what we
    consider a more dignified standard of personal relations we are
    willing to pay the penalty of frigidity in marriage and a huge toll
    of barren, unmarried women who move in unsatisfied procession across
    the American and English stage. But while granting the desirability of
    this development of sensitive, discriminating response to personality,
    as a better basis for dignified human lives than an automatic,
    undifferentiated response to sex attraction, we may still, in the light
    of Samoan solutions, count our methods exceedingly expensive. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>The
    strict segregation of related boys and girls, the institutionalised
    hostility between pre-adolescent children of opposite sexes in Samoa
    are cultural features with which we are completely out of sympathy. For
    the vestiges of such attitudes, expressed in our one-sex schools, we
    are trying to substitute coeducation, to habituate one sex to another
    sufficiently so that difference of sex will be lost sight of in the
    more important and more striking differences in personality. There are
    no recognisable gains in the Samoan system of taboo and segregation, of
    response to a group rather than response to an individual. But when we
    contrast the other factor of difference the conclusion is not so sure.
    What are the rewards of the tiny, ingrown, biological family opposing
    its closed circle of affection to a forbidding world, of the strong
    ties between parents and children, ties which imply an active personal
    relation from birth until death? Specialisation of affection, it is
    true, but at the price of many individuals’ preserving through life the
    attitudes of dependent children, of ties between parents and children
    which successfully defeat the children’s attempts to make other
    adjustments, of necessary choices made unnecessarily poignant because
    they become issues in an intense emotional relationship. Perhaps these
    are too heavy prices to pay for a specialisation of emotion which might
    be brought about in other ways, notably through coeducation. And with
    such a question in our minds it is interesting to note that a larger
    family community, in which there <span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>are several adult men and women,
    seems to ensure the child against the development of the crippling
    attitudes which have been labelled Œdipus complexes, Electra complexes,
    and so on.</p>

  <p>The Samoan picture shows that it is not necessary to channel so deeply
    the affection of a child for its parents and suggests that while we
    would reject that part of the Samoan scheme which holds no rewards for
    us, the segregation of the sexes before puberty, we may learn from a
    picture in which the home does not dominate and distort the life of the
    child.</p>

  <p>The presence of many strongly held and contradictory points of view and
    the enormous influence of individuals in the lives of their children
    in our country play into each other’s hands in producing situations
    fraught with emotion and pain. In Samoa the fact that one girl’s father
    is a domineering, dogmatic person, her cousin’s father a gentle,
    reasonable person, and another cousin’s father a vivid, brilliant,
    eccentric person, will influence the three girls in only one respect,
    choice of residence if any one of the three fathers is the head of
    a household. But the attitudes of the three girls towards sex, and
    towards religion, will not be affected by the different temperaments
    of their three fathers, for the fathers play too slight a rôle in
    their lives. They are schooled not by an individual but by an army of
    relatives into a general conformity upon which the personality of their
    parents has a very slight effect. And through an endless chain of cause
    and effect, individual <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>differences of standard are not perpetuated
    through the children’s adherence to the parents’ position, nor are
    children thrown into bizarre, untypical attitudes which might form
    the basis for departure and change. It is possible that where our own
    culture is so charged with choice, it would be desirable to mitigate,
    at least in some slight measure, the strong rôle which parents play in
    children’s lives, and so eliminate one of the most powerful accidental
    factors in the choices of any individual life.</p>

  <p>The Samoan parent would reject as unseemly and odious an ethical plea
    made to a child in terms of personal affection. “Be good to please
    mother.” “Go to church for father’s sake.” “Don’t be so disagreeable to
    your sister, it makes father so unhappy.” Where there is one standard
    of conduct and only one, such undignified confusion of ethics and
    affection is blessedly eliminated. But where there are many standards
    and all adults are striving desperately to bind their own children to
    the particular courses which they themselves have chosen, recourse is
    had to devious and non-reputable means. Beliefs, practices, courses of
    action, are pressed upon the child in the name of filial loyalty. In
    our ideal picture of the freedom of the individual and the dignity of
    human relations it is not pleasant to realise that we have developed
    a form of family organisation which often cripples the emotional
    life, and warps and confuses the growth of many individuals’ power to
    consciously live their own lives. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>The third element in the Samoan
    pattern of lack of personal relationships and lack of specialised
    affection, is the case of friendship. Here, most of all, individuals
    are placed in categories and the response is to the category,
    “relative,” or “wife of my husband’s talking chief,” or “son of my
    father’s talking chief,” or “daughter of my father’s talking chief.”
    Consideration of congeniality, of like-mindedness, are all ironed out
    in favour of regimented associations. Such attitudes we would of course
    reject completely.</p>

  <p>Drawing the threads of this particular discussion together, we may say
    that one striking difference between Samoan society and our own is the
    lack of the specialisation of feeling, and particularly of sex feeling,
    among the Samoans. To this difference is undoubtedly due a part of the
    lack of difficulty of marital adjustments in a marriage of convenience,
    and the lack of frigidity or psychic impotence. This lack of
    specialisation of feeling must be attributed to the large heterogeneous
    household, the segregation of the sexes before adolescence, and the
    regimentation of friendship—chiefly along relationship lines. And yet,
    although we deplore the prices in maladjusted and frustrated lives,
    which we must pay for the greater specialisation of sex feeling in
    our own society, we nevertheless vote the development of specialised
    response as a gain which we would not relinquish. But an examination
    of these three causal factors suggests that we might accomplish our
    desired end, the development of a consciousness of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>personality,
    through coeducation and free and unregimented friendships, and
    possibly do away with the evils inherent in the too intimate family
    organisation, thus eliminating a part of our penalty of maladjustment
    without sacrificing any of our dearly bought gains.</p>

  <p>The next great difference between Samoa and our own culture which may
    be credited with a lower production of maladjusted individuals is
    the difference in the attitude towards sex and the education of the
    children in matters pertaining to birth and death. None of the facts
    of sex or of birth are regarded as unfit for children, no child has to
    conceal its knowledge for fear of punishment or ponder painfully over
    little-understood occurrences. Secrecy, ignorance, guilty knowledge,
    faulty speculations resulting in grotesque conceptions which may have
    far-reaching results, a knowledge of the bare physical facts of sex
    without a knowledge of the accompanying excitement, of the fact of
    birth without the pains of labour, of the fact of death without the
    fact of corruption—all the chief flaws in our fatal philosophy of
    sparing children a knowledge of the dreadful truth—are absent In Samoa.
    Furthermore, the Samoan child who participates intimately in the lives
    of a host of relatives has many and varied experiences upon which
    to base its emotional attitudes. Our children, confined within one
    family circle (and such confinement is becoming more and more frequent
    with the growth of cities and the substitution of apartment houses
    with a transitory population for a neighbourhood of house-holders),
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>often owe their only experience with birth or death to the birth of
    a younger brother or sister or the death of a parent or grandparent.
    Their knowledge of sex, aside from children’s gossip, comes from an
    accidental glimpse of parental activity. This has several very obvious
    disadvantages. In the first place, the child is dependent for its
    knowledge upon birth and death entering its own home; the youngest
    child in a family where there are no deaths may grow to adult life
    without ever having had any close knowledge of pregnancy, experience
    with young children, or contact with death.</p>

  <p>A host of ill-digested fragmentary conceptions of life and death will
    fester in the ignorant, inexperienced mind and provide a fertile field
    for the later growth of unfortunate attitudes. Second, such children
    draw their experiences from too emotionally toned a field; one birth
    may be the only one with which they come in close contact for the first
    twenty years of their lives. And upon the accidental aspects of this
    particular birth their whole attitude is dependent. If the birth is
    that of a younger child who usurps the elder’s place, if the mother
    dies in child bed, or if the child which is born is deformed, birth
    may seem a horrible thing, fraught with only unwelcome consequences.
    If the only death bed at which one has ever watched is the death bed
    of one’s mother, the bare fact of death may carry all the emotion
    which that bereavement aroused, carry forever an effect out of all
    proportion to the particular deaths encountered later in life. And
    intercourse <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>seen only once or twice, between relatives towards
    whom the child has complicated emotional attitudes, may produce any
    number of false assumptions. Our records of maladjusted children are
    full of cases where children have misunderstood the nature of the
    sexual act, have interpreted it as struggle accompanied by anger,
    or as chastisement, have recoiled in terror from one highly charged
    experience. So our children are dependent upon accident for their
    experience of life and death; and those experiences which they are
    vouchsafed, lie within the intimate family circle and so are the worst
    possible way of learning general facts about which it is important to
    acquire no special, distorted attitudes. One death, two births, one sex
    experience, is a generous total for the child brought up under living
    conditions which we consider consonant with an American standard of
    living. And considering the number of illustrations which we consider
    it necessary to give of how to calculate the number of square feet of
    paper necessary to paper a room eight feet by twelve feet by fourteen
    feet, or how to parse an English sentence, this is a low standard of
    illustration. It might be argued that these are experiences of such
    high emotional tone that repetition is unnecessary. It might also be
    argued if a child were severely beaten before being given its first
    lesson in calculating how to paper a room, and as a sequel to the
    lesson, saw its father hit its mother with the poker, it would always
    remember that arithmetic lesson. But what it would <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>know about the real
    nature of the calculations involved in room-papering is doubtful. In
    one or two experiences, the child is given no perspective, no chance
    to relegate the grotesque and unfamiliar physical details of the life
    process to their proper place. False impressions, part impressions,
    repulsion, nausea, horror, grow up about some fact experienced only
    once under intense emotional stress and in an atmosphere unfavourable
    to the child’s attaining any real understanding.</p>

  <p>A standard of reticence which forbids the child any sort of comment
    upon its experiences makes for the continuance of such false
    impressions, such hampering emotional attitudes, questions such as,
    “Why were grandma’s lips so blue?” are promptly hushed. In Samoa, where
    decomposition sets in almost at once, a frank, naïve repugnance to the
    odours of corruption on the part of all the participants at a funeral
    robs the physical aspect of death of any special significance. So, in
    our arrangements, the child is not allowed to repeat his experiences,
    and he is not permitted to discuss those which he has had and correct
    his mistakes.</p>

  <p>With the Samoan child it is profoundly different. Intercourse,
    pregnancy, child birth, death, are all familiar occurrences. And the
    Samoan child experiences them in no such ordered fashion as we, were
    we to decide for widening the child’s experimental field, would regard
    as essential. In a civilisation which suspects privacy, children of
    neighbours will be accidental and unemotional spectators in a house
    where the head <span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>of the household is dying or the wife is delivered of a
    miscarriage. The pathology of the life processes is known to them, as
    well as the normal. One impression corrects an earlier one until they
    are able, as adolescents, to think about life and death and emotion
    without undue preoccupation with the purely physical details.</p>

  <p>It must not be supposed, however, that the mere exposure of children to
    scenes of birth and death would be a sufficient guarantee against the
    growth of undesirable attitudes. Probably even more influential than
    the facts which are so copiously presented to them, is the attitude of
    mind with which their elders regard the matter. To them, birth and sex
    and death are the natural, inevitable structure of existence, of an
    existence in which they expect their youngest children to share. Our
    so often repeated comment that “it’s not natural” for children to be
    permitted to encounter death would seem as incongruous to them as if
    we were to say it was not natural for children to see other people eat
    or sleep. And this calm, matter-of-fact acceptance of their children’s
    presence envelops the children in a protective atmosphere, saves them
    from shock and binds them closer to the common emotion which is so
    dignifiedly permitted them.</p>

  <p>As in every case, it is here impossible to separate attitude from
    practice and say which is primary. The distinction is made only for
    our use in another civilisation. The individual American parents, who
    believe in a practice like the Samoan, and permit their children <span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>to
    see adult human bodies and gain a wider experience of the functioning
    of the human body than is commonly permitted in our civilisation, are
    building upon sand. For the child, as soon as it leaves the protecting
    circle of its home, is blasted by an attitude which regards such
    experience in children as ugly and unnatural. As likely as not, the
    attempt of the individual parents will have done the child more harm
    than good, for the necessary supporting social attitude is lacking.
    This is just a further example of the possibilities of maladjustment
    inherent in a society where each home differs from each other home; for
    it is in the fact of difference that the strain lies rather than in the
    nature of the difference.</p>

  <p>Upon this quiet acceptance of the physical facts of life, the Samoans
    build, as they grow older, an acceptance of sex. Here again it is
    necessary to sort out which parts of their practice seem to produce
    results which we certainly deprecate, and which produce results which
    we desire. It is possible to analyse Samoan sex practice from the
    standpoint of development of personal relationships on the one hand,
    and of the obviation of specific difficulties upon the other.</p>

  <p>We have seen that the Samoans have a low level of appreciation of
    personality differences, and a poverty of conception of personal
    relations. To such an attitude the acceptance of promiscuity
    undoubtedly contributes. The contemporaneousness of several
    experiences, their short duration, the definite avoidance of forming
    any affectional ties, the blithe acceptance of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>dictates of a
    favourable occasion, as in the expectation of infidelity in any wife
    whose husband is long from home, all serve to make sex an end rather
    than a means, something which is valued in itself, and deprecated
    inasmuch as it tends to bind one individual to another. Whether such
    a disregard of personal relations is completely contingent upon
    the sex habits of the people is doubtful. It probably is also a
    reflection of a more general cultural attitude in which personality
    is consistently disregarded. But there is one respect in which these
    very practices make possible a recognition of personality which is
    often denied to many in our civilisation, because, from the Samoans’
    complete knowledge of sex, its possibilities and its rewards, they are
    able to count it at its true value. And if they have no preference
    for reserving sex activity for important relationships, neither do
    they regard relationships as important because they are productive of
    sex satisfaction. The Samoan girl who shrugs her shoulder over the
    excellent technique of some young Lothario is nearer to the recognition
    of sex as an impersonal force without any intrinsic validity, than
    is the sheltered American girl who falls in love with the first man
    who kisses her. From their familiarity with the reverberations which
    accompany sex excitement comes this recognition of the essential
    impersonality of sex attraction which we may well envy them; from the
    too slight, too casual practice comes the disregard of personality
    which seems to us unlovely.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>The fashion in which their sex practice
    reduces the possibility of neuroses has already been discussed. By
    discounting our category of perversion, as applied to practice, and
    reserving it for the occasional psychic pervert, they legislate a whole
    field of neurotic possibility out of existence. Onanism, homosexuality,
    statistically unusual forms of heterosexual activity, are neither
    banned nor institutionalised. The wider range which these practices
    give prevents the development of obsessions of guilt which are so
    frequent a cause of maladjustment among us. The more varied practices
    permitted heterosexually preserve any individual from being penalised
    for special conditioning. This acceptance of a wider range as “normal”
    provides a cultural atmosphere in which frigidity and psychic impotence
    do not occur and in which a satisfactory sex adjustment in marriage
    can always be established. The acceptance of such an attitude without
    in any way accepting promiscuity would go a long way towards solving
    many marital impasses and emptying our park benches and our houses of
    prostitution.</p>

  <p>Among the factors in the Samoan scheme of life which are influential in
    producing stable, well-adjusted, robust individuals, the organisation
    of the family and the attitude towards sex are undoubtedly the most
    important. But it is necessary to note also the general educational
    concept which disapproves of precocity and coddles the slow, the
    laggard, the inept. In a society where the tempo of life was faster,
    the rewards greater, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>the amount of energy expended larger, the
    bright children might develop symptoms of boredom. But the slower
    pace dictated by the climate, the complacent, peaceful society, and
    the compensation of the dance, in its blatant precocious display of
    individuality which drains off some of the discontent which the bright
    child feels, prevent any child from becoming too bored. And the dullard
    is not goaded and dragged along faster than he is able until, sick with
    making an impossible effort, he gives up entirely. This educational
    policy also tends to blur individual differences and so to minimise
    jealousy, rivalry, emulation, those social attitudes which arise out
    of discrepancies of endowment and are so far-reaching in their effects
    upon the adult personality.</p>

  <p>It is one way of solving the problem of differences between individuals
    and a method of solution exceedingly congenial to a strict adult world.
    The longer the child is kept in a subject, non-initiating state, the
    more of the general cultural attitude it will absorb, the less of a
    disturbing element it will become. Furthermore, if time is given them,
    the dullards can learn enough to provide a stout body of conservatives
    upon whose shoulders the burden of the civilisation can safely rest.
    Giving titles to young men would put a premium upon the exceptional;
    giving titles to men of forty, who have at last acquired sufficient
    training to hold them, assures the continuation of the usual. It also
    discourages the brilliant so that their social contribution is slighter
    than it might otherwise have been. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>We are slowly feeling our way
    towards a solution of this problem, at least in the case of formal
    education. Until very recently our educational system offered only
    two very partial solutions of the difficulties inherent in a great
    discrepancy between children of different endowment and different
    rates of development. One solution was to allow a sufficiently long
    time to each educational step so that all but the mentally defective
    could succeed, a method similar to the Samoan one and without its
    compensatory dance floor. The bright child, held back, at intolerably
    boring tasks, unless he was fortunate enough to find some other outlet
    for his unused energy, was likely to expend it upon truancy and general
    delinquency. Our only alternative to this was “skipping” a child from
    one grade to another, relying upon the child’s superior intelligence
    to bridge the gaps. This was a method congenial to American enthusiasm
    for meteoric careers from canal boat and log cabin to the White
    House. Its disadvantages in giving the child a sketchy, discontinuous
    background, in removing it from its age group, have been enumerated
    too often to need repetition here. But it is worthy of note that with
    a very different valuation of individual ability than that entertained
    by Samoan society we used for years one solution, similar and less
    satisfactory than theirs, in our formal educational attempts.</p>

  <p>The methods which experimental educators are substituting for these
    unsatisfactory solutions, schemes like the Dalton Plan, or the rapidly
    moving classes in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>which a group of children can move ahead at a high,
    even rate of speed without hurt to themselves or to their duller
    fellows, is a striking example of the results of applying reason to
    the institutions of our society. The old red school-house was almost
    as haphazard and accidental a phenomenon as the Samoan dance floor. It
    was an institution which had grown up in response to a vaguely felt,
    unanalysed need. Its methods were analogous to the methods used by
    primitive peoples, non-rationalised solutions of pressing problems. But
    the institutionalisation of different methods of education for children
    of different capacities and different rates of development is not like
    anything which we find in Samoa or in any other primitive society.
    It is the conscious, intelligent directing of human institutions in
    response to observed human needs.</p>

  <p>Still another factor in Samoan education which results in different
    attitudes is the place of work and play in the children’s lives. Samoan
    children do not learn to work through learning to play, as the children
    of many primitive peoples do. Nor are they permitted a period of lack
    of responsibility such as our children are allowed. From the time they
    are four or five years old they perform definite tasks, graded to their
    strength and intelligence, but still tasks which have a meaning in the
    structure of the whole society. This does not mean that they have less
    time for play than American children who are shut up in schools from
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>nine to three o’clock every day. Before the introduction of schools to
    complicate the ordered routine of their lives, the time spent by the
    Samoan child in running errands, sweeping the house, carrying water,
    and taking actual care of the baby, was possibly less than that which
    the American school child devotes to her studies.</p>

  <p>The difference lies not in the proportion of time in which their
    activities are directed and the proportion in which they are free, but
    rather in the difference of attitude. With the professionalisation
    of education and the specialisation of industrial tasks which has
    stripped the individual home of its former variety of activities,
    our children are not made to feel that the time they do devote to
    supervised activity is functionally related to the world of adult
    activity. Although this lack of connection is more apparent than real,
    it is still sufficiently vivid to be a powerful determinant in the
    child’s attitude. The Samoan girl who tends babies, carries water,
    sweeps the floor; or the little boy who digs for bait, or collects
    cocoanuts, has no such difficulty. The necessary nature of their tasks
    is obvious. And the practice of giving a child a task which he can do
    well and never permitting a childish, inefficient tinkering with adult
    apparatus, such as we permit to our children, who bang aimlessly and
    destructively on their fathers’ typewriters, results in a different
    attitude towards work. American children spend hours in schools
    learning tasks whose visible relation to their mothers’ <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>and fathers’
    activities is often quite impossible to recognise. Their participation
    in adults’ activities is either in terms of toys, tea-sets and dolls
    and toy automobiles, or else a meaningless and harmful tampering with
    the electric light system. (It must be understood that here, as always,
    when I say American, I do not mean those Americans recently arrived
    from Europe, who still present a different tradition of education. Such
    a group would be the Southern Italians, who still expect productive
    work from their children.)</p>

  <p>So our children make a false set of categories, work, play, and school;
    work for adults, play for children’s pleasure, and schools as an
    inexplicable nuisance with some compensations. These false distinctions
    are likely to produce all sorts of strange attitudes, an apathetic
    treatment of a school which bears no known relation to life, a false
    dichotomy between work and play, which may result either in a dread of
    work as implying irksome responsibility or in a later contempt for play
    as childish.</p>

  <p>The Samoan child’s dichotomy is different. Work consists of those
    necessary tasks which keep the social life going: planting and
    harvesting and preparation of food, fishing, house-building,
    mat-making, care of children, collecting of property to validate
    marriages and births and succession to titles and to entertain
    strangers, these are the necessary activities of life, activities
    in which every member of the community, down to the smallest child,
    has a part. Work is not a way of acquiring <span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>leisure; where every
    household produces its own food and clothes and furniture, where there
    is no large amount of fixed capital and households of high rank are
    simply characterised by greater industry in the discharge of greater
    obligations, our whole picture of saving, of investment, of deferred
    enjoyment, is completely absent. (There is even a lack of clearly
    defined seasons of harvest, which would result in special abundance of
    food and consequent feasting. Food is always abundant, except in some
    particular village where a few weeks of scarcity may follow a period
    of lavish entertaining.) Rather, work is something which goes on all
    the time for every one; no one is exempt; few are overworked. There is
    social reward for the industrious, social toleration for the man who
    does barely enough. And there is always leisure—leisure, be it noted,
    which is not the result of hard work or accumulated capital at all,
    but is merely the result of a kindly climate, a small population, a
    well-integrated social system, and no social demands for spectacular
    expenditure. And play is what one does with the time left over from
    working, a way of filling in the wide spaces in a structure of
    unirksome work.</p>

  <p>Play includes dancing, singing, games, weaving necklaces of flowers,
    flirting, repartee, all forms of sex activity. And there are social
    institutions like the ceremonial inter-village visit which partake of
    both work and play. But the distinctions between work as something one
    has to do but dislikes, and play as something <span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>one wants to do; of work
    as the main business of adults, play as the main concern of children,
    are conspicuously absent. Children’s play is like adults’ play in kind,
    interest, and in its proportion to work. And the Samoan child has no
    desire to turn adult activities into play, to translate one sphere into
    the other. I had a box of white clay pipes for blowing soap bubbles
    sent me. The children were familiar with soap bubbles, but their native
    method of blowing them was very inferior to the use of clay pipes. But
    after a few minutes’ delight in the unusual size and beauty of the soap
    bubbles, one little girl after another asked me if she might please
    take her pipe home to her mother, for pipes were meant to smoke, not to
    play with. Foreign dolls did not interest them, and they have no dolls
    of their own, although children of other islands weave dolls from the
    palm leaves from which Samoan children weave balls. They never make toy
    houses, nor play house, nor sail toy boats. Little boys would climb
    into a real outrigger canoe and practise paddling it within the safety
    of the lagoon. This whole attitude gave a greater coherence to the
    children’s lives than we often afford our children.</p>

  <p>The intelligibility of a child’s life among us is measured only in
    terms of the behaviour of other children. If all the other children go
    to school the child who does not feels incongruous in their midst. If
    the little girl next door is taking music lessons, why can’t Mary; or
    why must Mary take music lessons, if the other little <span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>girl doesn’t
    take them. But so sharp is our sense of difference between the concerns
    of children and of adults that the child does not learn to judge its
    own behaviour in relationship to adult life. So children often learn to
    regard play as something inherently undignified, and as adults mangle
    pitifully their few moments of leisure. But the Samoan child measures
    her every act of work or play in terms of her whole community; each
    item of conduct is dignified in terms of its realised relationship to
    the only standard she knows, the life of a Samoan village. So complex
    and stratified a society as ours cannot hope to develop spontaneously
    any such simple scheme of education. Again we will be hard put to it to
    devise ways of participation for children, and means of articulating
    their school life with the rest of life which will give them the same
    dignity which Samoa affords her children.</p>

  <p>Last among the cultural differences which may influence the emotional
    stability of the child is the lack of pressure to make important
    choices. Children are urged to learn, urged to behave, urged to work,
    but they are not urged to hasten in the choices which they make
    themselves. The first point at which this attitude makes itself felt
    is in the matter of the brother and sister taboo, a cardinal point of
    modesty and decency. Yet the exact stage at which the taboo should be
    observed is always left to the younger child. When it reaches a point
    of discretion, of understanding, it will of itself feel “ashamed” and
    establish the formal <span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>barrier which will last until old age. Likewise,
    sex activity is never urged upon the young people, nor marriage forced
    upon them at a tender age. Where the possibilities of deviation from
    the accepted standard are so slight, a few years leeway holds no threat
    for the society. The child who comes later to a realisation of the
    brother and sister taboo really endangers nothing.</p>

  <p>This laissez faire attitude has been carried over into the Samoan
    Christian Church. The Samoan saw no reason why young unmarried people
    should be pressed to make momentous decisions which would spoil part
    of their fun in life. Time enough for such serious matters after they
    were married or later still, when they were quite sure of what steps
    they were taking and were in less danger of falling from grace every
    month or so. The missionary authorities, realising the virtues of going
    slowly and sorely vexed to reconcile Samoan sex ethics with a Western
    European code, saw the great disadvantages of unmarried Church members
    who were not locked up in Church schools. Consequently, far from urging
    the adolescent to think upon her soul the native pastor advises her to
    wait until she is older, which she is only too glad to do.</p>

  <p>But, especially in the case of our Protestant churches, there is a
    strong preference among us for the appeal to youth. The Reformation,
    with its emphasis upon individual choice, was unwilling to accept the
    tacit habitual Church membership which was the Catholic <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>pattern,
    a membership marked by additional sacramental gifts but demanding
    no sudden conversion, no renewal of religious feeling. But the
    Protestant solution is to defer the choice only so far as necessary,
    and the moment the child reaches an age which may be called “years
    of discretion” it makes a strong, dramatic appeal. This appeal is
    reinforced by parental and social pressure; the child is bidden to
    choose now and wisely. While such a position in the churches which
    stem from the Reformation and its strong emphasis on individual choice
    was historically inevitable, it is regrettable that the convention has
    lasted so long. It has even been taken over by non-sectarian reform
    groups, all of whom regard the adolescent child as the most legitimate
    field of activity.</p>

  <p>In all of these comparisons between Samoan and American culture, many
    points are useful only in throwing a spotlight upon our own solutions,
    while in others it is possible to find suggestions for change. Whether
    or not we envy other peoples one of their solutions, our attitude
    towards our own solutions must be greatly broadened and deepened by
    a consideration of the way in which other peoples have met the same
    problems. Realising that our own ways are not humanly inevitable nor
    God-ordained, but are the fruit of a long and turbulent history, we may
    well examine in turn all of our institutions, thrown into strong relief
    against the history of other civilisations, and weighing them in the
    balance, be not afraid to find them wanting.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">EDUCATION FOR CHOICE</div>

  <p>We have been comparing point for point, our civilisation and the
    simpler civilisation of Samoa, in order to illuminate our own methods
    of education. If now we turn from the Samoan picture and take away
    only the main lesson which we learned there, that adolescence is not
    necessarily a time of stress and strain, but that cultural conditions
    make it so, can we draw any conclusions which might bear fruit in the
    training of our adolescents?</p>

  <p>At first blush the answer seems simple enough. If adolescents are
    only plunged into difficulties and distress because of conditions in
    their social environment, then by all means let us so modify that
    environment as to reduce this stress and eliminate this strain and
    anguish of adjustment. But, unfortunately, the conditions which vex
    our adolescents are the flesh and bone of our society, no more subject
    to straightforward manipulation upon our part than is the language
    which we speak. We can alter a syllable here, a construction there;
    but the great and far-reaching changes in linguistic structure (as
    in all parts of culture) are the work of time, a work in which each
    individual plays an unconscious and inconsiderable part. The principal
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>causes of our adolescents’ difficulty are the presence of conflicting
    standards and the belief that every individual should make his or her
    own choices, coupled with a feeling that choice is an important matter.
    Given these cultural attitudes, adolescence, regarded now not as a
    period of physiological change, for we know that physiological puberty
    need not produce conflict, but as the beginning of mental and emotional
    maturity, is bound to be filled with conflicts and difficulties. A
    society which is clamouring for choice, which is filled with many
    articulate groups, each urging its own brand of salvation, its own
    variety of economic philosophy, will give each new generation no peace
    until all have chosen or gone under, unable to bear the conditions of
    choice. The stress is in our civilisation, not in the physical changes
    through which our children pass, but it is none the less real nor the
    less inevitable in twentieth-century America.</p>

  <p>And if we look at the particular forms which this need for choice
    takes, the difficulty of the adolescent’s position is only documented
    further. Because the discussion is principally concerned with girls, I
    shall discuss the problem from the girls’ point of view, but in many
    respects the plight of the adolescent boy is very similar. Between
    fourteen and eighteen, the average American boy and girl finish school.
    They are now ready to go to work and must choose what type of work they
    wish to do. It might be argued that they often have remarkably little
    choice. Their education, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>the part of the country in which they live,
    their skill with their hands, will combine to dictate choice perhaps
    between the job of cash girl in a department store or of telephone
    operator, or of clerk or miner. But small as is the number of choices
    open to them in actuality, the significance of this narrow field of
    opportunity is blurred by our American theory of endless possibilities.
    Moving picture, magazine, newspaper, all reiterate the Cinderella
    story in one form or another, and often the interest lies as much in
    the way cash girl 456 becomes head buyer as in her subsequent nuptials
    with the owner of the store. Our occupational classes are not fixed.
    So many children are better educated and hold more skilled positions
    than their parents that even the ever-present discrepancy between
    opportunities open to men and opportunities open to women, although
    present in a girl’s competition with her brother, is often absent as
    between her unskilled father and herself. It is needless to argue that
    these attitudes are products of conditions which no longer exist,
    particularly the presence of a frontier and a large amount of free
    land which provided a perpetual alternative of occupational choice. A
    set which was given to our thinking in pioneer days is preserved in
    other terms. As long as we have immigrants from non-English-speaking
    countries, the gap in opportunities between non-English-speaking
    parents and English-speaking children will be vivid and dramatic.
    Until our standard of education becomes far more stable than it is
    at present, the continual raising <span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>of the age and grade until which
    schooling is compulsory ensures a wide educational gap between many
    parents and their children. And occupational shifts like the present
    movements of farmers and farm workers into urban occupations, give
    the same picture. When the agricultural worker pictures urban work
    as a step up in the social scale, and the introduction of scientific
    farming is so radically reducing the numbers needed in agriculture,
    the movement of young people born on the farm to city jobs is bound to
    dazzle the imagination of our farming states during the next generation
    at least. The substitution of machines for unskilled workers and the
    absorption of many of the workers and their children into positions
    where they manipulate machines affords another instance of the kind of
    historical change which keeps our myth of endless opportunity alive.
    Add to these special features, like the effect upon the prospects of
    Negro children of the tremendous exodus from the southern corn fields,
    or upon the children of New England mill-hands who are deprived of an
    opportunity to follow duly in their parents’ footsteps and must at
    least seek new fields if not better ones.</p>

  <p>Careful students of the facts may tell us that class lines are becoming
    fixed; that while the children of immigrants make advances beyond
    their parents, they move up in step; that there are fewer spectacular
    successes among them than there used to be; that it is much more
    possible to predict the future status of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>child from the present
    status of the parent. But this measured comment of the statistician
    has not filtered into our literature, nor our moving pictures, nor in
    any way served to minimise the vividness of the improvement in the
    children’s condition as compared with the condition of their parents.
    Especially in cities, there is no such obvious demonstration of the
    fact that improvement is the rule for the children of a given class
    or district, and not merely a case of John Riley’s making twenty
    dollars a week as a crossing man while Mary, his daughter, who has
    gone to business school, makes twenty-five dollars a week, working
    shorter hours. The lure of correspondence school advertising, the
    efflorescence of a doctrine of short-cuts to fame, all contrive to
    make an American boy or girl’s choice of a job different from that of
    English children, born into a society where stratification is so old,
    so institutionalised, that the dullest cannot doubt it. So economic
    conditions force them to go to work and everything combines to make
    that choice a difficult one, whether in terms of abandoning a care-free
    existence for a confining, uncongenial one, or in terms of bitter
    rebellion against the choice which they must make in contrast to the
    opportunities which they are told are open to all Americans.</p>

  <p>And taking a job introduces other factors of difficulty into the
    adolescent girl’s home situation. Her dependence has always been
    demonstrated in terms of limits and curbs set upon her spontaneous
    activity in every <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>field from spending money to standards of dress and
    behaviour. Because of the essentially pecuniary nature of our society,
    the relationship of limitation in terms of allowance to limitation
    of behaviour are more far-reaching than in earlier times. Parental
    disapproval of extreme styles of clothing would formerly have expressed
    itself in a mother’s making her daughter’s dresses high in the neck
    and long in the sleeve. Now it expresses itself in control through
    money. If Mary doesn’t stop purchasing chiffon stockings, Mary shall
    have no money to buy stockings. Similarly, a taste for cigarettes
    and liquor can only be gratified through money; going to the movies,
    buying books and magazines of which her parents disapprove, are all
    dependent upon a girl’s having the money, as well as upon her eluding
    more direct forms of control. And the importance of a supply of money
    in gratifying all of a girl’s desires for clothes and for amusement
    makes money the easiest channel through which to exert parental
    authority. So easy is it, that the threat of cutting off an allowance,
    taking away the money for the one movie a week or the coveted hat, has
    taken the place of the whippings and bread-and-water exiles which were
    favourite disciplinary methods in the last century. The parents come
    to rely upon this method of control. The daughters come to see all
    censoring of their behaviour, moral, religious or social, the ethical
    code and the slightest sumptuary provisions in terms of an economic
    threat. And then at sixteen or <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>seventeen the daughter gets a job. No
    matter how conscientiously she may contribute her share to the expenses
    of the household, it is probably only in homes where a European
    tradition still lingers that the wage-earning daughter gives all of
    her earning to her parents. (This, of course, excludes the cases where
    the daughter supports her parents, where the vesting of the economic
    responsibility in her hands changes the picture of parental control in
    another fashion.) For the first time in her life, she has an income of
    her own, with no strings of morals or of manners attached to its use.
    Her parents’ chief instrument of discipline is shattered at one blow,
    but not their desire to direct their daughters’ lives. They have not
    pictured their exercise of control as the right of those who provide,
    to control those for whom they provide. They have pictured it in far
    more traditional terms, the right of parents to control their children,
    an attitude reinforced by years of practising such control.</p>

  <p>But the daughter is in the position of one who has yielded unwillingly
    to some one who held a whip in his hand, and now sees the whip
    broken. Her unwillingness to obey, her chafing under special parental
    restrictions which children accept as inevitable in simpler cultures,
    is again a feature of our conglomerate civilisation. When all the
    children in the community go to bed at curfew, one child is not as
    likely to rail against her parents for enforcing the rule. But when the
    little girl next door is allowed to stay up until eleven o’clock, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>why
    must Mary go to bed at eight? If all of her companions at school are
    allowed to smoke, why can’t she? And conversely, for it is a question
    of the absence of a common standard far more than of the nature of the
    standards, if all the other little girls are given lovely fussy dresses
    and hats with flowers and ribbons, why must she be dressed in sensible,
    straight linen dresses and simple round hats? Barring an excessive and
    passionate devotion of the children to their parents, a devotion of a
    type which brings other more serious difficulties in its wake, children
    in a heterogeneous civilisation will not accept unquestioningly their
    parents’ judgment, and the most obedient will temper present compliance
    with the hope of future emancipation.</p>

  <p>In a primitive, homogeneous community, disciplinary measures of
    parents are expended upon securing small concessions from children,
    in correcting the slight deviations which occur within one pattern of
    behaviour. But in our society, home discipline is used to establish
    one set of standards as over against other sets of standards, each
    family group is fighting some kind of battle, bearing the onus of
    those who follow a middle course, stoutly defending a cause already
    lost in the community at large, or valiantly attempting to plant a new
    standard far in advance of their neighbours. This propagandist aspect
    greatly increases the importance of home discipline in the development
    of a girl’s personality. So we have the picture of parents, shorn of
    their economic authority, trying to coerce the girl who still <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>lives
    beneath their roof into an acceptance of standards against which she is
    rebelling. In this attempt they often find themselves powerless and as
    a result the control of the home breaks down suddenly, and breaks down
    just at the point where the girl, faced with other important choices,
    needs a steadying home environment.</p>

  <p>It is at about this time that sex begins to play a rôle in the girl’s
    life, and here also conflicting choices are presented to her. If
    she chooses the freer standards of her own generation, she comes in
    conflict with her parents, and perhaps more importantly with the
    ideals which her parents have instilled. The present problem of the
    sex experimentation of young people would be greatly simplified if it
    were conceived of as experimentation instead of as rebellion, if no
    Puritan self-accusations vexed their consciences. The introduction of
    an experimentation so much wider and more dangerous presents sufficient
    problems in our lack of social canons for such behaviour. For a new
    departure in the field of personal relations is always accompanied by
    the failure of those who are not strong enough to face an unpatterned
    situation. Canons of honour, of personal obligation, of the limits of
    responsibilities, grow up only slowly. And, of first experimenters,
    many perish in uncharted seas. But when there is added to the pitfalls
    of experiment, the suspicion that the experiment is wrong and the need
    for secrecy, lying, fear, the strain is so great that frequent downfall
    is inevitable. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>And if the girl chooses the other course, decides to
    remain true to the tradition of the last generation, she wins the
    sympathy and support of her parents at the expense of the comradeship
    of her contemporaries. Whichever way the die falls, the choice is
    attended by mental anguish. Only occasional children escape by various
    sorts of luck, a large enough group who have the same standards so
    that they are supported either against their parents or against the
    majority of their age mates, or by absorption in some other interest.
    But, with the exception of students for whom the problem of personal
    relations is sometimes mercifully deferred for a later settlement,
    those who find some other interest so satisfying that they take no
    interest in the other sex, often find themselves old maids without any
    opportunity to recoup their positions. The fear of spinsterhood is a
    fear which shadows the life of no primitive woman; it is another item
    of maladjustment which our civilisation has produced.</p>

  <p>To the problem of present conduct are added all the perplexities
    introduced by varying concepts of marriage, the conflict between
    deferring marriage until a competence is assured, or marrying and
    sharing the expenses of the home with a struggling young husband.
    The knowledge of birth control, while greatly dignifying human
    life by introducing the element of choice at the point where
    human beings have before been most abjectly subject to nature,
    introduces further perplexities. It complicates the issue from a
    straight <span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>marriage-home-and-children plan of life versus independent
    spinsterhood by permitting marriages without children, earlier
    marriages, marriages and careers, sex relations without marriage and
    the responsibility of a home. And because the majority of girls still
    wish to marry and regard their occupations as stop-gaps, these problems
    not only influence their attitude towards men, but also their attitude
    towards their work, and prevent them from having a sustained interest
    in the work which they are forced to do.</p>

  <p>Then we must add to the difficulties inherent in a new economic status
    and the necessity of adopting some standard of sex relations, ethical
    and religious issues to be solved. Here again the home is a powerful
    factor; the parents use every ounce of emotional pressure to enlist
    their children in one of the dozen armies of salvation. The stress
    of the revival meeting, the pressure of pastor and parent gives them
    no peace. And the basic difficulties of reconciling the teachings of
    authority with the practices of society and the findings of science,
    all trouble and perplex children already harassed beyond endurance.</p>

  <p>Granting that society presents too many problems to her adolescents,
    demands too many momentous decisions on a few months’ notice, what is
    to be done about it? One panacea suggested would be to postpone at
    least some of the decisions, keep the child economically dependent, or
    segregate her from all contact with the other sex, present her with
    only one set of religious <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>ideas until she is older, more poised,
    better able to deal critically with the problems which will confront
    her. In a less articulate fashion, such an idea is back of various
    schemes for the prolongation of youth, through raising the working age,
    raising the school age, shielding school children from a knowledge of
    controversies like evolution versus fundamentalism, or any knowledge
    of sex hygiene or birth control. Even if such measures, specially
    initiated and legislatively enforced, could accomplish the end which
    they seek and postpone the period of choice, it is doubtful whether
    such a development would be desirable. It is unfair that very young
    children should be the battleground for conflicting standards, that
    their development should be hampered by propagandist attempts to
    enlist and condition them too young. It is probably equally unfair to
    culturally defer the decisions too late. Loss of one’s fundamental
    religious faith is more of a wrench at thirty than at fifteen simply
    in terms of the number of years of acceptance which have accompanied
    the belief. A sudden knowledge of hitherto unsuspected aspects of sex,
    or a shattering of all the old conventions concerning sex behaviour,
    is more difficult just in terms of the strength of the old attitudes.
    Furthermore, in practical terms, such schemes would be as they are now,
    merely local, one state legislating against evolution, another against
    birth control, or one religious group segregating its unmarried girls.
    And these special local movements would simply unfit groups of young
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>people for competing happily with children who had been permitted to
    make their choices earlier. Such an educational scheme, in addition
    to being almost impossible of execution, would be a step backward and
    would only beg the question.</p>

  <p>Instead, we must turn all of our educational efforts to training our
    children for the choices which will confront them. Education, in the
    home even more than at school, instead of being a special pleading for
    one régime, a desperate attempt to form one particular habit of mind
    which will withstand all outside influences, must be a preparation for
    those very influences. Such an education must give far more attention
    to mental and physical hygiene than it has given hitherto. The child
    who is to choose wisely must be healthy in mind and body, handicapped
    in no preventable fashion. And even more importantly, this child of
    the future must have an open mind. The home must cease to plead an
    ethical cause or a religious belief with smiles or frowns, caresses or
    threats. The children must be taught how to think, not what to think.
    And because old errors die slowly, they must be taught tolerance,
    just as to-day they are taught intolerance. They must be taught that
    many ways are open to them, no one sanctioned above its alternative,
    and that upon them and upon them alone lies the burden of choice.
    Unhampered by prejudices, unvexed by too early conditioning to any one
    standard, they must come clear-eyed to the choices which lie before
    them. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>For it must be realised by any student of civilisation that
    we pay heavily for our heterogeneous, rapidly changing civilisation;
    we pay in high proportions of crime and delinquency, we pay in the
    conflicts of youth, we pay in an ever-increasing number of neuroses, we
    pay in the lack of a coherent tradition without which the development
    of art is sadly handicapped. In such a list of prices, we must count
    our gains carefully, not to be discouraged. And chief among our gains
    must be reckoned this possibility of choice, the recognition of many
    possible ways of life, where other civilisations have recognised only
    one. Where other civilisations give a satisfactory outlet to only one
    temperamental type, be he mystic or soldier, business man or artist, a
    civilisation in which there are many standards offers a possibility of
    satisfactory adjustment to individuals of many different temperamental
    types, of diverse gifts and varying interests.</p>

  <p>At the present time we live in a period of transition. We have many
    standards but we still believe that only one standard can be the right
    one. We present to our children the picture of a battle-field where
    each group is fully armoured in a conviction of the righteousness
    of its cause. And each of these groups make forays among the next
    generation. But it is unthinkable that a final recognition of the great
    number of ways in which man, during the course of history and at the
    present time, is solving the problems of life, should not bring with
    it in turn the downfall of our belief in <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>a single standard. And when
    no one group claims ethical sanction for its customs, and each group
    welcomes to its midst only those who are temperamentally fitted for
    membership, then we shall have realised the high point of individual
    choice and universal toleration which a heterogeneous culture and a
    heterogeneous culture alone can attain. Samoa knows but one way of life
    and teaches it to her children. Will we, who have the knowledge of many
    ways, leave our children free to choose among them?</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

  <p>Pages 43 to 45.</p>

  <p>In the Samoan classification of relatives two principles, sex and age,
    are of the most primary importance. Relationship terms are never used
    as terms of address, a name or nickname being used even to father or
    mother. Relatives of the same age or within a year or two younger to
    five or ten years older are classified as of the speaker’s generation,
    and of the same sex or of the opposite sex. Thus a girl will call her
    sister, her aunt, her niece, and her female cousin who are nearly of
    the same age, <i lang="sm">uso</i>, and a boy will do the same for his brother,
    uncle, nephew, or male cousin. For relationships between siblings of
    opposite sex there are two terms, <i lang="sm">tuafafine</i> and <i lang="sm">tuagane</i>,
    female relative of the same age group of a male, and male relative
    of the same age group of a female. (The term <i lang="sm">uso</i> has no such
    subdivisions.)</p>

  <p>The next most important term is applied to younger relatives of either
    sex, the word <i lang="sm">tei</i>. Whether a child is so classified by an older
    relative depends not so much on how many years younger the child may
    be, but rather on the amount of care that the elder has taken of
    it. So a girl will call a cousin two years younger than herself her
    <i lang="sm">tei</i>, if she has lived near by, but an equally youthful cousin
    who has grown up in a distant village until both are grown will be
    called <i lang="sm">uso</i>. It is notable that there is no term for elder
    relative. The terms <i lang="sm">uso</i>, <i lang="sm">tufafine</i> and <i lang="sm">tuagane</i> all
    carry the feeling of contemporaneousness, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>and if it is necessary to
    specify seniority, a qualifying adjective must be used.</p>

  <p><i lang="sm">Tamā</i>, the term for father, is applied also to the <i lang="sm">matai</i>
    of a household, to an uncle or older cousin with whose authority
    a younger person comes into frequent contact and also to a much
    older brother who in feeling is classed with the parent generation.
    <i lang="sm">Tinā</i> is used only a little less loosely for the mother, aunts
    resident in the household, the wife of the <i lang="sm">matai</i> and only very
    occasionally for an older sister.</p>

  <p>A distinction is also made in terminology between men’s terms and
    women’s terms for the children. A woman will say <i lang="sm">tama</i> (modified
    by the addition of the suffixes <i lang="sm">tane</i> and <i lang="sm">fafine</i>, male
    and female) and a man will say <i lang="sm">atalii</i>, son and <i lang="sm">afafine</i>,
    daughter. Thus a woman will say, “Losa is my <i lang="sm">tama</i>,” specifying
    her sex only when necessary. But Losa’s father will speak of Losa as
    his <i lang="sm">afafine</i>. The same usage is followed in speaking <em>to</em>
    a man or <em>to</em> a woman or a child. All of these terms are further
    modified by the addition of the word, <i lang="sm">moni</i>, real, when a blood
    sister or blood father or mother is meant. The elders of the household
    are called roughly <i lang="sm">matua</i>, and a grandparent is usually referred
    to as the <i lang="sm">toa’ina</i>, the “old man” or <i lang="sm">olamatua</i>, “old
    woman,” adding an explanatory clause if necessary. All other relatives
    are described by the use of relative clauses, “the sister of the
    husband of the sister of my mother,” “the brother of the wife of my
    brother,” etc. There are no special terms for the in-law group.</p>

  <p>For the sake of convenience the households were numbered in sequence
    from one end of each village to the other. The <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>houses did not stretch
    in a straight line along the beach, but were located so unevenly that
    occasionally one house was directly behind another. A schematic linear
    representation will, however, be sufficient to show the effect of
    location in the formation of neighbourhood groups.</p>

  <p>The first person singular of the verb “to know,” used in the negative,
    has two forms:<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2em;">Ta ilo (Contraction of Ta</span><span style="padding-left: 3em;">te</span>
    <span style="padding-left: 3em;">lē</span><span style="padding-left: 3em;">iloa)</span><br>
    <span style="padding-left: 11.3em;">I</span><span style="padding-left: 2em;">euphonic</span><span style="padding-left: 1.2em;">neg.</span>
    <span style="padding-left: 1.9em;">know</span><br>
    <span style="padding-left: 13.9em;">particle</span><br>
    and<br>
    <span style="padding-left: 2em;">Ua</span><span style="padding-left: 2em;">le</span>
    <span style="padding-left: 2em;">iloa</span><span style="padding-left: 2em;">a’u</span><br>

    <span style="padding-left: 1.8em;">Part.</span></p>

  <p>The former of these expressions has a very different meaning from
    the latter although linguistically they represent optional syntactic
    forms, the second being literally, “I do not know,” while the first can
    best be rendered by the slang phrase, “Search me.” This “Search me”
    carries no implication of lack of actual knowledge or information about
    the subject in question but is merely an indication either of lack
    of interest or unwillingness to explain. That the Samoans feel this
    distinction very clearly is shown by the frequent use of both forms in
    the same sentence: <i lang="sm">Ta ilo ua lē iloa a’u</i>. “Search me, I don’t
    know.”</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

  <p>Pages 132 to 133.</p>

  <p>The children of this age already show a very curious example of a
    phonetic self-consciousness in which they are almost <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>as acute and
    discriminating as their elders. When the missionaries reduced the
    language to writing, there was no <em>k</em> in the language, the
    <em>k</em> positions in other Polynesian dialects being filled in Samoan
    either with a <em>t</em> or a glottal stop. Soon after the printing
    of the Bible, and the standardisation of Samoan spelling, greater
    contact with Tonga introduced the <em>k</em> into the spoken language
    of Savai’i and Upolu, displacing the <em>t</em>, but not replacing the
    glottal stop. Slowly this intrusive usage spread eastward over Samoa,
    the missionaries who controlled the schools and the printing press
    fighting a dogged and losing battle with the less musical <em>k</em>.
    To-day the <em>t</em> is the sound used in the speech of the educated
    and in the church, still conventionally retained in all spelling and
    used in speeches and on occasions demanding formality. The Manu’a
    children who had never been to the missionary boarding schools, used
    the <em>k</em> entirely. But they had heard the <em>t</em> in church and at
    school and were sufficiently conscious of the difference to rebuke me
    immediately if I slipped into the colloquial <em>k</em>, which was their
    only speech habit, uttering the <em>t</em> sound for perhaps the first
    time in their lives to illustrate the correct pronunciation from which
    I, who was ostensibly learning to speak correctly, must not deviate.
    Such an ability to disassociate the sound used from the sound heard is
    remarkable in such very young children and indeed remarkable in any
    person who is not linguistically sophisticated.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

  <p>Pages 161 to 163.</p>

  <p>During six months I saw six girls leave the pastor’s establishment
    for several reasons: Tasi, because her mother was ill and she, that
    rare phenomenon, the eldest in a biological household, was needed at
    home; Tua, because she had come out lowest in the missionaries’ annual
    examination which her <span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>mother attributed to favouritism on the part
    of the pastor; Luna, because her stepmother, whom she disliked, left
    her father and thus made her home more attractive and because under
    the influence of a promiscuous older cousin she began to tire of the
    society of younger girls and take an interest in love affairs; Lita,
    because her father ordered her home, because with the permission of the
    pastor, but without consulting her family, she went off for a three
    weeks’ visit in another island. Going home for Lita involved residence
    in the far end of the other village, necessitating a complete change of
    friends. The novelty of the new group and new interests kept her from
    in any way chafing at the change. Sala, a stupid idle girl, had eloped
    from the household of the pastor.</p>

    <h2 class="nobreak" id="Appendix_II">APPENDIX II</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">METHODOLOGY OF THIS STUDY</div>

  <p>It is impossible to present a single and unified picture of the
    adolescent girl in Samoa and at the same time to answer most
    satisfactorily the various kinds of questions which such a study will
    be expected to answer. For the ethnologist in search of data upon the
    usages and rites connected with adolescence it is necessary to include
    descriptions of customs which have fallen into partial decay under
    the impact of western propaganda and foreign example. Traditional
    observances and attitudes are also important in the study of the
    adolescent girl in present-day Samoa because they still form a large
    part of the thought pattern of her parents, even if they are no longer
    given concrete expression in the girl’s cultural life. But this double
    necessity of describing not only the present environment and the girl’s
    reaction to it, but also of interpolating occasionally some description
    of the more rigid cultural milieu of her mother’s girlhood, mars to
    some extent the unity of the study.</p>

  <p>The detailed observations were all made upon a group of girls living
    in three practically contiguous villages on one coast of the island of
    Taū. The data upon the ceremonial usages surrounding birth, adolescence
    and marriage were gathered from all of the seven villages in the Manu’a
    Archipelago.</p>

  <p>The method of approach is based upon the assumption that a detailed
    intensive investigation will be of more value than a more diffused
    and general study based upon a less accurate knowledge of a greater
    number of individuals. Dr. Van Waters’ study of <cite>The Adolescent
    Girl Among Primitive <span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>Peoples</cite> has exhausted the possibilities of
    an investigation based upon the merely external observations of the
    ethnologist who is giving a standardised description of a primitive
    culture. We have a huge mass of general descriptive material without
    the detailed observations and the individual cases in the light of
    which it would be possible to interpret it.</p>

  <p>The writer therefore chose to work in one small locality, in a group
    numbering only six hundred people, and spend six months accumulating
    an intimate and detailed knowledge of all the adolescent girls in this
    community. As there were only sixty-eight girls between the ages of
    nine and twenty, quantitative statements are practically valueless for
    obvious reasons: the probable error of the group is too large; the
    age classes are too small, etc. The only point at which quantitative
    statements can have any relevance is in regard to the variability
    within the group, as the smaller the variability within the sample, the
    greater the general validity of the results.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the type of data which we needed is not of the sort which
    lends itself readily to quantitative treatment. The reaction of the
    girl to her stepmother, to relatives acting as foster parents, to her
    younger sister, or to her older brother,—these are incommensurable in
    quantitative terms. As the physician and the psychiatrist have found it
    necessary to describe each case separately and to use their cases as
    illumination of a thesis rather than as irrefutable proof such as it
    is possible to adduce in the physical sciences, so the student of the
    more intangible and psychological aspects of human behaviour is forced
    to illuminate rather than demonstrate a thesis. The composition of the
    background against which the girl acts can be described in accurate and
    general terms, but her reactions are a function of her own personality
    and cannot be described without reference to it. The generalisations
    are based upon a careful and detailed observation of a small group of
    subjects. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>These results will be illuminated and illustrated by case
    histories.</p>

  <p>The conclusions are also all subject to the limitation of the personal
    equation. They are the judgments of one individual upon a mass of
    data, many of the most significant aspects of which can, by their
    very nature, be known only to herself. This was inevitable and it can
    only be claimed in extenuation that as the personal equation was held
    absolutely constant, the different parts of the data are strictly
    commensurable. The judgment on the reaction of Lola to her uncle and of
    Sona to her cousin are made on exactly the same basis.</p>

  <p>Another methodological device which possibly needs explanation is the
    substitution of a cross sectional study for a linear one. Twenty-eight
    children who as yet showed no signs of puberty, fourteen children
    who would probably mature within the next year or year and a half,
    and twenty-five girls who had passed puberty within the last four
    years but were not yet classed by the community as adults, were
    studied in detail. Less intensive observations were also made upon
    the very little children and the young married women. This method of
    taking cross sections, samples of individuals at different periods of
    physical development, and arguing that a group in an earlier stage
    will later show the characteristics which appear in another group at
    a later stage, is, of course, inferior to a linear study in which the
    same group is under observation for a number of years. A very large
    number of cases has usually been the only acceptable defence of such a
    procedure. The number of cases included in this investigation, while
    very small in comparison with the numbers mustered by any student
    of American children, is nevertheless a fair-sized sample in terms
    of the very small population of Samoa (a rough eight thousand in
    all four islands of American Samoa) and because the only selection
    was geographical. It may further be argued that the almost drastic
    character of the conclusions, the exceedingly <span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>few exceptions which
    need to be made, further validate the size of the sample. The adoption
    of the cross section method was, of course, a matter of expediency, but
    the results when carefully derived from a fair sample, may be fairly
    compared with the results obtained by using the linear method, when the
    same subjects are under observation over a period of years. This is
    true when the conclusions to be drawn are general and not individual.
    For the purposes of psychological theory, it is sufficient to know
    that children in a certain society walk, on the average, at twelve
    months, and talk, on the average, at fifteen months. For the purposes
    of the diagnostician, it is necessary to know that John walked at
    eighteen months and did not talk until twenty months. So, for general
    theoretical purposes, it is enough to state that little girls just past
    puberty develop a shyness and lack of self-possession in the presence
    of boys, but if we are to understand the delinquency of Mala, it is
    necessary to know that she prefers the company of boys to that of girls
    and has done so for several years.</p>

  <h4>PARTICULAR METHODS USED</h4>

  <p>The description of the cultural background was obtained in orthodox
    fashion, first through interviews with carefully chosen informants,
    followed by checking up their statements with other informants and
    by the use of many examples and test cases. With a few unimportant
    exceptions this material was obtained in the Samoan language and not
    through the medium of interpreters. All of the work with individuals
    was done in the native language, as there were no young people on the
    island who spoke English.</p>

  <p>Although a knowledge of the entire culture was essential for the
    accurate evaluation of any particular individual’s behaviour, a
    detailed description will be given only of those aspects of the culture
    which are immediately relevant to the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>problem of the adolescent girl.
    For example, if I observe Pele refuse point blank to carry a message
    to the house of a relative, it is important to know whether she is
    actuated by stubbornness, dislike of the relative, fear of the dark,
    or fear of the ghost which lives near by and has a habit of jumping
    on people’s backs. But to the reader a detailed exposition of the
    names and habits of all the local ghost population would be of little
    assistance in the appreciation of the main problem. So all descriptions
    of the culture which are not immediately relevant are omitted from the
    discussion but were not omitted from the original investigation. Their
    irrelevancy has, therefore, been definitely ascertained.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of the general cultural pattern was supplemented by a
    detailed study of the social structure of the three villages under
    consideration. Each household was analysed from the standpoint of
    rank, wealth, location, contiguity to other households, relationship
    to other households, and the age, sex, relationship, marital status,
    number of children, former residence, etc., of each individual in the
    household. This material furnished a general descriptive basis for a
    further and more careful analysis of the households of the subjects,
    and also provided a check on the origin of feuds or alliances between
    individuals, the use of relationship terms, etc. Each child was thus
    studied against a background which was known in detail.</p>

  <p>A further mass of detailed information was obtained about the subjects:
    approximate age (actual age can never be determined in Samoa), order
    of birth, numbers of brothers and sisters, who were older and younger
    than the subject, number of marriages of each parent, patrilocal and
    matrilocal residence, years spent in the pastor’s school and in the
    government school and achievement there, whether the child had ever
    been out of the village or off the island, sex experience, etc. The
    children were also given a makeshift intelligence test, colour-naming,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>rote memory, opposites, substitution, ball and field, and picture
    interpretation. These tests were all given in Samoan; standardisation
    was, of course, impossible and ages were known only relatively; they
    were mainly useful in assisting me in placing the child within her
    group, and have no value for comparative purposes. The results of
    the tests did indicate, however, a very low variability within the
    group. The tests were supplemented by a questionnaire which was not
    administered formally but filled in by random questioning from time to
    time. This questionnaire gave a measure of their industrial knowledge,
    the extent to which they participated in the lore of the community,
    of the degree to which they had absorbed European teaching in matters
    like telling time, reading the calendar, and also of the extent to
    which they had participated in or witnessed scenes of death, birth,
    miscarriage, etc.</p>

  <p>But this quantitative data represents the barest skeleton of the
    material which was gathered through months of observation of the
    individuals and of groups, alone, in their households, and at play.
    From these observations, the bulk of the conclusions are drawn
    concerning the attitudes of the children towards their families and
    towards each other, their religious interests or the lack of them, and
    the details of their sex lives. This information cannot be reduced to
    tables or to statistical statements. Naturally in many cases it was
    not as full as in others. In some cases it was necessary to pursue a
    more extensive enquiry in order to understand some baffling aspect
    of the child’s behaviour. In all cases the investigation was pursued
    until I felt that I understood the girl’s motivation and the degree to
    which her family group and affiliation in her age group explained her
    attitudes.</p>

  <p>The existence of the pastor’s boarding-school for girls past puberty
    provided me with a rough control group. These girls were so severely
    watched that heterosexual activities were impossible; <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>they were
    grouped together with other girls of the same age regardless of
    relationship; they lived a more ordered and regular life than the girls
    who remained in their households. The ways in which they differed from
    other girls of the same age and more resembled European girls of the
    same age follow with surprising accuracy the lines suggested by the
    specific differences in environment. However, as they lived part of the
    time at home, the environmental break was not complete and their value
    as a control group is strictly limited.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">SAMOAN CIVILISATION AS IT IS TO-DAY</div>

  <p>The scene of this study was the little island of Taū. Along one coast
    of the island, which rises precipitately to a mountain peak in the
    centre, cluster three little villages, Lumā and Siufaga, side by side,
    and Faleasao, half a mile away. On the other end of the island is the
    isolated village of Fitiuta, separated from the other three villages by
    a long and arduous trail. Many of the people from the other villages
    have never been to Fitiuta, eight miles away. Twelve miles across
    the open sea are the two islands of Ofu and Olesega, which with Taū,
    make up the Manu’a Archipelago, the most primitive part of Samoa.
    Journeys in slender outrigger canoes from one of these three little
    islands to another are frequent, and the inhabitants of Manu’a think of
    themselves as a unit as over against the inhabitants of Tutuila, the
    large island where the Naval Station is situated. The three islands
    have a population of a little over two thousand people, with constant
    visiting, inter-marrying, adoption going on between the seven villages
    of the Archipelago.</p>

  <p>The natives still live in their beehive-shaped houses with floors of
    coral rubble, no walls except perishable woven blinds which are lowered
    in bad weather, and a roof of sugar-cane thatch over which it is
    necessary to bind palm branches in every storm. They have substituted
    cotton cloth for their laboriously manufactured bark cloth for use
    as everyday clothing, native costume being reserved for ceremonial
    occasions. But the men content themselves with a wide cotton loin
    cloth, the <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>, fastened at the waist with a dexterous
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>twist of the material. This costume permits a little of the tattooing
    which covers their bodies from knee to the small of the back, to
    appear above and below the folds of the <i lang="sm">lavalava</i>. Tattooing
    has been taboo on Manu’a for two generations, so only a part of the
    population have made the necessary journey to another island in search
    of a tattooer. Women wear a longer <i lang="sm">lavalava</i> and a short cotton
    dress falling to their knees. Both sexes go barefoot and hats are worn
    only to Church, on which occasions the men don white shirts and white
    coats, ingeniously tailored by the native women in imitation of Palm
    Beach coats which have fallen into their hands. The women’s tattooing
    is much sparser than the men’s, a mere matter of dots and crosses on
    arms, hands, and thighs. Garlands of flowers, flowers in the hair, and
    flowers twisted about the ankles, serve to relieve the drabness of the
    faded cotton clothing, and on gala days, beautifully patterned bark
    cloth, fine mats, gaily bordered with red parrot feathers, headdresses
    of human hair decorated with plumes and feathers, recall the more
    picturesque attire of pre-Christian days.</p>

  <p>Sewing-machines have been in use for many years, although the natives
    are still dependent upon some deft-handed sailor for repairs. Scissors
    have also been added to the household equipment, but wherever possible
    a Samoan woman still uses her teeth or a piece of bamboo. At the
    Missionary boarding-schools a few of the women have learned to crochet
    and embroider, using their skill particularly to ornament the plump,
    hard pillows which are rapidly displacing the little bamboo head rests.
    Sheets of white cotton have taken the place of sheets of firmly woven
    mats or of bark cloth. Mosquito nets of cotton netting make a native
    house much more endurable than must have been the case when bark cloth
    tents were the only defence against insects. The netting is suspended
    at night from stout cords hung across the house, and the edges weighted
    down with stones, so that prowling dogs, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>pigs, and chickens wander
    through the house at will without disturbing the sleepers.</p>

  <p>Agate buckets share with hollowed cocoanut shells the work of bringing
    water from the springs and from the sea, and a few china cups and
    glasses co-operate with the cocoanut drinking cups. Many households
    have an iron cook pot in which they can boil liquids in preference
    to the older method of dropping red hot stones into a wooden vessel
    containing the liquid to be heated. Kerosene lamps and lanterns are
    used extensively; the old candle-nut clusters and cocoanut oil lamps
    being reinstated only in times of great scarcity when they cannot
    afford to purchase kerosene. Tobacco is a much-prized luxury; the
    Samoans have learned to grow it, but imported varieties are very much
    preferred to their own.</p>

  <p>Outside the household the changes wrought by the introduction of
    European articles are very slight. The native uses an iron knife to cut
    his copra and an iron adze blade in place of the old stone one. But he
    still binds the rafters of his house together with cinet and sews the
    parts of his fishing canoes together. The building of large canoes has
    been abandoned. Only small canoes for fishing are built now, and for
    hauling supplies over the reef the natives build keeled rowboats. Only
    short voyages are made in small canoes and rowboats, and the natives
    wait for the coming of the Naval ship to do their travelling. The
    government buys the copra and with the money so obtained the Samoans
    buy cloth, thread, kerosene, soap, matches, knives, belts, and tobacco,
    pay their taxes (levied on every man over a certain height as age is an
    indeterminate matter), and support the church.</p>

  <p>And yet, while the Samoans use these products of a more complex
    civilisation, they are not dependent upon them. With the exception of
    making and using stone tools, it is probably safe to say that none of
    the native arts have been lost. The women all make bark cloth and weave
    fine mats. Parturition <span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>still takes place on a piece of bark cloth,
    the umbilical cord is cut with a piece of bamboo, and the new baby is
    wrapped in a specially prepared piece of white bark cloth. If soap
    cannot be obtained, the wild orange provides a frothy substitute. The
    men still manufacture their own nets, make their own hooks, weave their
    own eel traps. And although they use matches when they can get them,
    they have not lost the art of converting a carrying stick into a fire
    plow at a moment’s notice.</p>

  <p>Perhaps most important of all is the fact that they still depend
    entirely upon their own foods, planted with a sharpened pole in their
    own plantations. Breadfruit, bananas, taro, yams, and cocoanuts form a
    substantial and monotonous accompaniment for the fish, shell fish, land
    crabs, and occasional pigs and chickens. The food is carried down to
    the village in baskets, freshly woven from palm leaves. The cocoanuts
    are grated on the end of a wooden “horse,” pointed with shell or iron;
    the breadfruit and taro are supported on a short stake, tufted with
    cocoanut husk, and the rind is grated off with a piece of cocoanut
    shell. The green bananas are skinned with a bamboo knife. The whole
    amount of food for a family of fifteen or twenty for two or three days
    is cooked at once in a large circular pit of stones. These are first
    heated to white heat; the ashes are then raked away; the food placed on
    the stones and the oven covered with green leaves, under which the food
    is baked thoroughly. Cooking over, the food is stored in baskets which
    are hung up inside the main house. It is served on palm leaf platters,
    garnished with a fresh banana leaf. Fingers are the only knives and
    forks, and a wooden finger bowl is passed ceremoniously about at the
    end of the meal.</p>

  <p>Furniture, with the exception of a few chests and cupboards, has not
    invaded the house. All life goes on on the floor. Speaking on one’s
    feet within the house is still an unforgivable <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>breach of etiquette,
    and the visitor must learn to sit cross-legged for hours without
    murmuring.</p>

  <p>The Samoans have been Christian for almost a hundred years. With the
    exception of a small number of Catholics and Mormons, all the natives
    of American Samoa are adherents of the London Missionary Society,
    known in Samoa as the “Church of Tahiti,” from its local origin. The
    Congregationalist missionaries have been exceedingly successful in
    adapting the stern doctrine and sterner ethics of a British Protestant
    sect to the widely divergent attitudes of a group of South Sea
    islanders. In the Missionary boarding-schools they have trained many
    boys as native pastors and as missionaries for other islands, and many
    girls to be the pastors’ wives. The pastor’s house is the educational
    as well as the religious centre of the village. In the pastor’s school
    the children learn to read and write their own language, to which the
    early missionaries adapted our script, to do simple sums and sing
    hymns. The missionaries have been opposed to teaching the natives
    English, or in any way weaning them away from such of the simplicity
    of their primitive existence as they have not accounted harmful.
    Accordingly, although the elders of the church preach excellent sermons
    and in many cases have an extensive knowledge of the Bible (which has
    been translated into Samoan), although they keep accounts, and transact
    lengthy business affairs, they speak no English, or only very little of
    it. On Taū there were never more than half a dozen individuals at one
    time who had any knowledge of English.</p>

  <p>The Naval Government has adopted the most admirable policy of
    benevolent non-interference in native affairs. It establishes
    dispensaries and conducts a hospital where native nurses are trained.
    These nurses are sent out into the villages where they have surprising
    success in the administration of the very simple remedies at their
    command, castor oil, iodine, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>argyrol, alcohol rubs, etc. Through
    periodic administrations of salvarsan the more conspicuous symptoms of
    yaws are rapidly disappearing. And the natives are learning to come to
    the dispensaries for medicine rather than aggravate conjunctivitis to
    blindness by applying irritating leaf poultices to the inflamed eyes.</p>

  <p>Reservoirs have been constructed in most of the villages, providing an
    unpolluted water supply at a central fountain where all the washing
    and bathing is done. Copra sheds in each village store the copra
    until the government ship comes to fetch it. Work on copra sheds,
    on village boats used in hauling the copra over the reef, on roads
    between villages, on the repairs of the water system, is carried
    through by a levy upon the village as a whole, conforming perfectly to
    the native pattern of communal work. The government operates through
    appointed district governors and county chiefs, and elected “mayors”
    in each village. The administrations of these officials are peaceful
    and effective in proportion to the importance of their rank in the
    native social organisation. Each village also has two policemen who act
    as town criers, couriers on government inspections, and carriers of
    the nurses’ equipment from village to village. There are also county
    judges. A main court is presided over by an American civil judge and
    a native judge. The penal code is a random combination of government
    edicts, remarkable for their tolerance of native custom. When no
    pronouncement on a point of law is found in this code, the laws of the
    state of California, liberally interpreted and revised, are used to
    provide a legalistic basis for the court’s decision. These courts have
    taken over the settlement of disputes concerning important titles, and
    property rights; and the chief causes of litigation in the “courthouse”
    at Pago Pago are the same which agitated the native <i lang="sm">fonos</i> some
    hundred years ago.</p>

  <p>Schools are now maintained in many villages, where the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>children,
    seated cross-legged on the floor of a large native house, learn the
    haziest of English from boys whose knowledge of the language is
    little more extensive than theirs. They also learn part singing, at
    which they are extraordinarily adept, and to play cricket and many
    other games. The schools are useful in instilling elementary ideas
    of hygiene, and in breaking down the barriers between age and sex
    groups and narrow residential units. From the pupils in the outlying
    schools the most promising are selected to become nurses, teachers,
    and candidates for the native marine corps, the <i lang="sm">Fitafitas</i>, who
    constitute the police, hospital corpsmen and interpreters for the naval
    administration. The Samoans’ keen feeling for social distinction makes
    them particularly able to co-operate with a government in which there
    is a hierarchy of officialdom; the shoulder stars and bars are fitted
    into their own system of rank without confusion. When the Governor
    and group of officers pay an official visit, the native-talking chief
    distributes the kava, first to the Governor, then to the highest chief
    among the hosts, then to the Commander of the Naval Yard, then to the
    next highest chief, without any difficulty.</p>

  <p>In all the descriptions of Samoan life, one of the points which must
    have struck the reader most forcibly is the extreme flexibility of the
    civilisation as it is found to-day. This flexibility is the result
    of the blending of the various European ideas, beliefs, mechanical
    devices, with the old primitive culture. It is impossible to say
    whether it is due to some genius in the Samoan culture itself, or to
    fortunate accident, that these foreign elements have received such
    a thorough and harmonious acculturation. In many parts of the South
    Seas contact with white civilisation has resulted in the complete
    degeneration of native life, the loss of native techniques, and
    traditions, and the annihilation of the past. In Samoa this is not
    so. The growing child is faced by a smaller <span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>dilemma than that which
    confronts the American-born child of European parentage. The gap
    between parents and children is narrow and painless, showing few of
    the unfortunate aspects usually present in a period of transition.
    The new culture, by offering alternative careers to the children has
    somewhat lightened the parental yoke. But essentially the children
    are still growing up in a homogeneous community with a uniform set of
    ideals and aspirations. The present ease of adolescence among Samoan
    girls which has been described cannot safely be attributed to a period
    of transition. The fact that adolescence can be a period of unstressed
    development is just as significant. Given no additional outside
    stimulus or attempt to modify conditions, Samoan culture might remain
    very much the same for two hundred years.</p>

  <p>But it is only fair to point out that Samoan culture, before white
    influence, was less flexible and dealt less kindly with the individual
    aberrant. Aboriginal Samoa was harder on the girl sex delinquent than
    is present-day Samoa. And the reader must not mistake the conditions
    which have been described for the aboriginal ones, nor for typical
    primitive ones. Present-day Samoan civilisation is simply the result
    of the fortuitous and on the whole fortunate impetus of a complex,
    intrusive culture upon a simpler and most hospitable indigenous one.</p>

  <p>In former times, the head of the household had life and death powers
    over every individual under his roof. The American legal system and
    the missionary teachings between them have outlawed and banished
    these rights. The individual still benefits by the communal ownership
    of property, by the claims which he has on all family land; but he
    no longer suffers from an irksome tyranny which could be enforced
    with violence and possible death. Deviations from chastity were
    formerly punished in the case of girls by a very severe beating and a
    stigmatising shaving of the head. Missionaries have discouraged the
    beating and head shaving, but <span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>failed to substitute as forceful an
    inducement to circumspect conduct. The girl whose sex activities are
    frowned upon by her family is in a far better position than that of her
    great-grandmother. The navy has prohibited, the church has interdicted
    the defloration ceremony, formerly an inseparable part of the marriages
    of girls of rank; and thus the most potent inducement to virginity has
    been abolished. If for these cruel and primitive methods of enforcing
    a stricter régime there had been substituted a religious system which
    seriously branded the sex offender, or a legal system which prosecuted
    and punished her, then the new hybrid civilisation might have been as
    heavily fraught with possibilities of conflict as the old civilisation
    undoubtedly was.</p>

  <p>This holds true also for the ease with which young people change their
    residence. Formerly it might have been necessary to flee to a great
    distance to avoid being beaten to death. Now the severe beatings are
    deprecated, but the running-away pattern continues. The old system
    of succession must have produced many heartburns in the sons who
    did not obtain the best titles; to-day two new professions are open
    to the ambitious, the ministry and the <i lang="sm">Fitafitas</i>. The taboo
    system, although never as rigorous in Samoa as in other parts of
    Polynesia, undoubtedly compelled the people to lead more circumspect
    lives and stressed more vividly difference in rank. The few economic
    changes which have been introduced have been just sufficient to
    slightly upset the system of prestige which was based on display and
    lavish distribution of property. Acquiring wealth is easier, through
    raising copra, government employment, or manufacturing curios for the
    steamer-tourist trade on the main island. Many high chiefs do not find
    it worth while to keep up the state to which they are entitled, while
    numerous upstarts have an opportunity to acquire prestige denied to
    them under a slower method of accumulating wealth. The intensity of
    local feeling with its resulting <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>feuds, wars, jealousies and conflicts
    (in the case of inter-marriage between villages) is breaking down with
    the improved facilities for transportation and the co-operation between
    villages in religious and educational matters.</p>

  <p>Superior tools have partially done away with the tyranny of the master
    craftsman. The man who is poor, but ambitious, finds it easier to
    acquire a guest house than it would have been when the laborious highly
    specialised work was done with stone tools. The use of some money and
    of cloth, purchased from traders, has freed women from part of the
    immense labour of manufacturing mats and tapa as units of exchange and
    for clothing. On the other hand, the introduction of schools has taken
    an army of useful little labourers out of the home, especially in the
    case of the little girls who cared for the babies, and so tied the
    adult women more closely to routine domestic tasks.</p>

  <p>Puberty was formerly much more stressed than it is to-day. The
    menstrual taboos against participation in the kava ceremony and in
    certain kinds of cooking were felt and enforced. The girl’s entrance
    into the <i lang="sm">Aualuma</i> was always, not just occasionally, marked by a
    feast. The unmarried girls and the widows slept, at least part of the
    time, in the house of the <i lang="sm">taupo</i>. The <i lang="sm">taupo</i> herself had a
    much harder life. To-day she pounds the kava root, but in her mother’s
    day it was chewed until jaws ached from the endless task. Formerly,
    should a defection from chastity be disclosed at her marriage, she
    faced being beaten to death. The adolescent boy faced tattooing, a
    painful, wearisome proceeding, additionally stressed by group ceremony
    and taboo. To-day, scarcely half of the young men are tattooed;
    the tattooing is performed at a much more advanced age and has no
    connection with puberty; the ceremonies have vanished and it has become
    a mere matter of a fee to the artist.</p>

  <p>The prohibitions against blood revenge and personal violence <span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>have
    worked like a yeast in giving greater personal freedom. As many of the
    crimes which were formerly punished in this fashion are not recognised
    as crimes by the new authorities, no new mechanism of punishment has
    been devised for the man who marries the divorced wife of a man of
    higher rank, the miscreant who gossips outside his village and so
    brings his village into disrepute, the insolent detractor who recites
    another’s genealogy, or the naughty boy who removes the straws from the
    pierced cocoanuts and thus offers an unspeakable affront to visitors.
    And the Samoan is not in the habit of committing many of the crimes
    listed in our legal code. He steals and is fined by the government as
    he was formerly fined by the village. But he comes into very slight
    conflict with the central authorities. He is too accustomed to taboos
    to mind a quarantine prohibition which parades under the same guise;
    too accustomed to the exactions of his relations to fret under the
    small taxation demands of the government. Even the stern attitude
    formerly taken by the adults towards precocity has now been subdued,
    for what is a sin at home becomes a virtue at school.</p>

  <p>The new influences have drawn the teeth of the old culture.
    Cannibalism, war, blood revenge, the life and death power of the
    <i lang="sm">matai</i>, the punishment of a man who broke a village edict by
    burning his house, cutting down his trees, killing his pigs, and
    banishing his family, the cruel defloration ceremony, the custom
    of laying waste plantations on the way to a funeral, the enormous
    loss of life in making long voyages in small canoes, the discomfort
    due to widespread disease—all these have vanished. And as yet their
    counterparts in producing misery have not appeared.</p>

  <p>Economic instability, poverty, the wage system, the separation of the
    worker from his land and from his tools, modern warfare, industrial
    disease, the abolition of leisure, the irksomeness of a bureaucratic
    government—these have not yet <span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>invaded an island without resources
    worth exploiting. Nor have the subtler penalties of civilisation,
    neuroses, philosophical perplexities, the individual tragedies
    due to an increased consciousness of personality and to a greater
    specialisation of sex feeling, or conflicts between religion and other
    ideals, reached the natives. The Samoans have only taken such parts of
    our culture as made their life more comfortable, their culture more
    flexible, the concept of the mercy of God without the doctrine of
    original sin.</p>

  <div class="subheadc">THE MENTALLY DEFECTIVE AND THE MENTALLY DISEASED</div>

  <p>Without any training in the diagnosis of the mentally diseased and
    without any apparatus for exact diagnosis of the mentally defective,
    I can simply record a number of amateur observations which may be of
    interest to the specialist interested in the possibilities of studying
    the pathology of primitive peoples. In the Manu’a Archipelago with a
    population of a little over two thousand people, I saw one case which
    would be classed as idiocy, one imbecile, one boy of fourteen who
    appeared to be both feeble-minded and insane, one man of thirty who
    showed a well-systematised delusion of grandeur, and one sexual invert
    who approximated in a greater development of the breasts, mannerism
    and attitudes of women and a preference for women’s activities, to the
    norm of the opposite sex. The idiot child was one of seven children;
    he had a younger brother who had walked for over a year, and the
    mother declared that there were two years between the children. His
    legs were shrunken and withered, he had an enormous belly and a large
    head set very low on his shoulders. He could neither walk nor talk,
    drooled continually, and had no command over his excretory functions.
    The imbecile girl lived on another island and I had no opportunity to
    observe her over any length of time. She was one or two years past
    puberty and was pregnant at the time that I saw her. She could talk and
    perform the simple tasks usually performed by children of five or six.
    She seemed to only half realise her condition and giggled foolishly
    or stared vacantly when it was <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>mentioned. The fourteen-year-old
    boy was at the time when I saw him definitely demented, giving an
    external picture of catatonic dementia præcox. He took those attitudes
    which were urged upon him, at times, however, becoming violent and
    unmanageable. The relatives insisted that he had always been stupid but
    only recently become demented. For this I have only their word as I
    was only able to observe the boy during a few days. In no one of these
    three cases of definite mental deficiency was there any family history
    which threw any light upon the matter. Among the girls whom I studied
    in detail only one, Sala, discussed in <a href="#Chapter_X">Chapter X</a>, was sufficiently
    inferior to the general norm of intelligence to approximate to a moron.</p>

  <p>The man with the systematised delusion of grandeur was said to be
    about thirty years of age. Gaunt and emaciated, he looked much older.
    He believed that he was Tufele, the high chief of another island and
    the governor of the entire archipelago. The natives conspired against
    him to rob him of his rank and to exalt an usurper in his stead. He
    was a member of the Tufele family but only very remotely so that his
    delusion bore no relation to reality as he would never have had any
    hope of succeeding to the title. The natives, he said, refused to give
    him food, mocked him, disallowed his claims, did their best to destroy
    him, while a few white people were wise enough to recognise his rank.
    (The natives instructed visitors to address him in the chief’s language
    because he consented to dance, a weird pathetic version of the usual
    style, only when so opportuned.) He had no outbreaks of violence, was
    morose, recessive, only able to work at times and never able to do
    heavy work or to be trusted to carry through any complicated task. He
    was treated with universal gentleness and toleration by his relatives
    and neighbours.</p>

  <p>From informants I obtained accounts of four cases on Tutuila which
    sounded like the manic stage of manic depressive insanity. All four of
    these individuals had been violently <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>destructive, and uncontrollable
    for a period of time, but had later resumed what the natives considered
    normal functioning. An old woman who had died some ten years before
    was said to have compulsively complied with any command that was given
    her. There was one epileptic boy in Taū, a member of an otherwise
    normal family of eight children. He fell from a tree during a seizure
    and died from a fractured skull soon after I came to Manu’a. A little
    girl of about ten who was paralysed from the waist down was said to be
    suffering from an overdose of salvarsan and to have been normal until
    she was five or six years old.</p>

  <p>Only two individuals, one a married woman of thirty or so, the
    other a girl of nineteen, discussed in <a href="#Chapter_X">Chapter X</a>, showed a definite
    neurasthenic constitution. The married woman was barren and spent a
    great deal of time explaining her barrenness as need of an operation.
    The presence of an excellent surgeon at the Samoan hospital during the
    preceding two years had greatly enhanced the prestige of operations.
    On Tutuila, near the Naval Station, I encountered several middle-aged
    women obsessed with operations which they had undergone or were soon
    to undergo. Whether this vogue of modern surgery, by giving it special
    point, has added to the amount of apparent neurasthenia or not, it is
    impossible to say.</p>

  <p>Of hysterical manifestations, I encountered only one, a girl of
    fourteen or fifteen with a bad tic in the right side of her face. I
    only saw her for a few minutes on a journey and was unable to make any
    investigations. I neither saw nor heard of any cases of hysterical
    blindness or deafness, nor or any anæsthesias nor paralyses.</p>

  <p>I saw no cases of cretinism. There were a few children who had
    been blind from birth. Blindness, due to the extremely violent
    methods used by the native practitioners in the treatment of “Samoan
    conjunctivitis,” is common.</p>

  <p>The pathology which is immediately apparent to any visitor <span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>in a
    Samoan village is mainly due to the diseased eyes, elephantiasis, and
    abscesses and sores of various sorts, but the stigmata of degeneration
    are almost entirely absent.</p>

  <p>There was one albino, a girl of ten, with no albinism in the recorded
    family history, but as one parent, now dead, had come from another
    island, this was not at all conclusive data.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="subheadc">MATERIALS UPON WHICH THE ANALYSIS IS BASED</div>

  <p>This study included sixty-eight girls between the ages of eight and
    nine and nineteen or twenty—all the girls between these ages in the
    three villages of Faleasao, Lumā and Siufaga, the three villages on the
    west coast of the island of Taū in the Manu’a Archipelago of the Samoan
    Islands.</p>

  <p>Owing to the impossibility of obtaining accurate dates of birth except
    in a very few cases, the ages must all be regarded as approximate. The
    approximations were based upon the few known ages and the testimony
    of relatives as to the relative age of the others. For purpose of
    description and analysis I have divided them roughly into three groups,
    the children who showed no mammary signs of puberty, twenty-eight in
    number, ranging in age from eight or nine to about twelve or thirteen;
    the children who would probably mature within the next year or year and
    a half, fourteen in number, ranging in age from twelve or thirteen to
    fourteen or fifteen; and the girls who were past puberty, but who were
    not yet considered as adults by the community, twenty-five in number,
    ranging in age from fourteen or fifteen to nineteen or twenty. These
    two latter groups and eleven of the younger children were studied in
    detail, making a group of fifty. The remaining fourteen children in
    the youngest group were studied less carefully as individuals. They
    formed a large check group in studying play, gang life, the development
    of brother and sister avoidance, the attitude between the sexes,
    the difference in the interests and activities of this age and the
    girls approaching puberty. They also provided abundant material for
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>the study of the education and discipline of the child in the home.
    The two tables present in summary form the major statistical facts
    which were gathered about the children specially studied, order of
    birth, number of brothers and sisters, death or remarriage or divorce
    of parents, residence of the child, type of household in which the
    child lived and whether the girl was the daughter of the head of the
    household or not. The second table relates only to the twenty-five
    girls past puberty and gives length of time since first menstruation,
    frequency of menstruation, amount and location of menstrual pain,
    the presence or absence of masturbation, homosexual and heterosexual
    experience, and the very pertinent fact of residence or non-residence
    in the pastor’s household. A survey of the summary analyses joined to
    these tables will show that these fifty girls present a fairly wide
    range in family organisation, order of birth, and relation to parents.
    The group may be fairly considered as representative of the various
    types of environment, personal and social, which are found in Samoan
    civilisation as it is to-day.</p>

  <h3 id="Intelligence_Tests">INTELLIGENCE TESTS USED</h3>

  <p>It was impossible to standardise any intelligence tests and
    consequently my results are quantitatively valueless. But as I had had
    some experience in the diagnostic use of tests, I found them useful in
    forming a preliminary estimate of the <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>girls’ intelligence. Also, the
    natives have long been accustomed to examinations which the missionary
    authorities conduct each year, and the knowledge that an examination is
    in progress makes them respect the privacy of investigator and subject.
    In this way it was possible for me to get the children alone, without
    antagonising their parents. Furthermore, the novelty of the tests,
    especially the colour-naming and picture interpretation tests, served
    to divert their attention from other questions which I wished to ask
    them. The results of the tests showed a much narrower range than would
    be expected in a group varying in age from ten to twenty. Without any
    standardisation it is impossible to draw any more detailed conclusions.
    I shall, however, include a few comments about the peculiar responses
    which the girls made to particular tests, as I believe such comment is
    useful in evaluating intelligence testing among primitive peoples and
    also in estimating the possibilities of such testing.</p>

  <p class="mb0"><i>Tests Used</i></p>

  <ul class="hang mt0" style="list-style-type: none;">
    <li>Colour Naming. 100 half-inch squares, red, yellow, black and blue.</li>
    <li>Rote Memory for Digits. Customary Stanford Binet directions
      were used.</li>
    <li>Digit Symbol Substitution. 72 one-inch figures, square, circle,
      cross, triangle and diamond.</li>
    <li>Opposites. 23 words. Stimulus words: fat, white, long, old,
      tall, wise, beautiful, late, night, near, hot, win, thick,
      sweet, tired, slow, rich, happy, darkness, up, inland, inside, sick.</li>
    <li>Picture Interpretation. Three reproductions from the moving
      picture <i>Moana</i>, showing, (<i>a</i>) Two children who had
      caught a cocoanut crab by smoking it out of the rocks above
      them, (<i>b</i>) A canoe putting out to sea after bonito as
      evidenced by the shape of the canoe <span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>and the position of the
      crew, (<i>c</i>) A Samoan girl sitting on a log eating a small
      live fish which a boy, garlanded and stretched on the ground at
      her feet, had given her.</li>
    <li>Ball and Field. Standard-sized circle.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Standard directions were given throughout in all cases entirely in
    Samoan. Many children, unused to such definitely set tasks, although
    all are accustomed to the use of slate and of pencil and paper, had
    to be encouraged to start. The ball and field test was the least
    satisfactory as in over fifty per cent of the cases the children
    followed an accidental first line and simply completed an elaborate
    pattern within the circle. When this pattern happened by accident
    to be either the Inferior or Superior solution, the child’s comment
    usually betrayed the guiding idea as æsthetic rather than as an
    attempt to solve the problem. The children whom I was led to believe
    to be most intelligent, subordinated the æsthetic consideration to
    the solution of the problem, but the less intelligent children were
    sidetracked by their interest in the design they could make much
    more easily than are children in our civilisation. In only two cases
    did I find a rote memory for digits which exceeded six digits; two
    girls completing seven successfully. The Samoan civilisation puts the
    slightest of premiums upon rote memory of any sort. On the digit-symbol
    test they were slow to understand the point of the test and very few
    learned the combinations before the last line of the test sheet. The
    picture interpretation test was the most subject to vitiation through
    a cultural factor; almost all of the children adopted some highly
    stylized form of comment and then pursued it through one balanced
    sentence after another: “Beautiful is the boy and beautiful is the
    girl. Beautiful is the garland of the boy and beautiful is the wreath
    of the girl,” etc. In the two pictures which emphasised human beings no
    discussion could be commenced until the question of <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>the relationship
    of the characters had been ascertained. The opposites test was the
    one which they did most easily, a natural consequence of a vivid
    interest in words, an interest which leads them to spend most of their
    mythological speculation upon punning explanations of names.</p>

  <h3 id="Check_List">Check List USED IN INVESTIGATION OF EACH GIRL’S EXPERIENCE</h3>

  <p>In order to standardise this investigation I made out a questionnaire
    which I filled out for each girl. The questions were not asked
    consecutively but from time to time I added one item of information
    after another to the record sheets. The various items fell into the
    loose groupings indicated below.</p>
